  Abstract                 = {Hourly temperature forecasts are important for electrical load forecasting and other applications in industry, agriculture, and the environment. Modern machine learning techniques including neural networks have been used for this purpose. We propose using the alternative abductive networks approach, which offers the advantages of simplified and more automated model synthesis and transparent analytical inputâ€“output models. Dedicated hourly models were developed for next-day and next-hour temperature forecasting, both with and without extreme temperature forecasts for the forecasting day, by training on hourly temperature data for 5 years and evaluation on data for the 6th year. Next-day and next-hour models using extreme temperature forecasts give an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.68&#xa0;Â°F and 1.05&#xa0;Â°F, respectively. Next-hour models may also be used sequentially to provide next-day forecasts. Performance compares favourably with neural network models developed using the same data, and with more complex neural networks, reported in the literature, that require daily training. Performance is significantly superior to naive forecasts based on persistence and climatology. },

  Abstract                 = {{The Amboseli basin, a semi-arid, open savannah area of southern Kenya, has experienced extensive changes in habitat since the early 1960's. The present report documents patterns of air temperature and rainfall in Amboseli for the 25-year period beginning 1976. Daily temperatures increased dramatically throughout this time period, at a rate almost an order of magnitude greater than that attributed to global warming. Mean daily maximum temperature increased more than did daily minimum (0.275 vs. 0.071degreesC per annum). Although increases in mean daily maxima were documented for all months of the year, they were greatest during the hottest months, February and March. Annual rainfall varied more than four-fold (x = 346.5 mm, SD = 120.0, range 132.0-553.4 mm), yet did not exhibit any directional or other regular pattern of variability among years over this same 25-year period. Empirical as well as theoretical investigation of relations between such changes in climatic conditions and habitat characteristics are needed at local and regional as well as global scales.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Prior to the 1976-77 climate shift (1950-76), sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean consisted of a basinwide warming during boreal fall of the developing phase of most El Ni (n) over tilde os, whereas after the shift (1977-99) they had an east-west asymmetry-a consequence of El Ni (n) over tildeo being associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole/Zonal mode. In this study, the possible impact of these contrasting, SST patterns on the ongoing El Ni (n) over tildeo is investigated, using atmospheric reanalysis products and solutions to both an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and a simple atmospheric model (LBM), with the latter used to identify basic processes. Specifically, analyses of reanalysis products during the El Ni (n) over tildeo onset indicate that after the climate shift a low-level anticyclone over the South China Sea was shifted into the Bay of Bengal and that equatorial westerly anomalies in the Pacific Ocean were considerably stronger. The present study focuses on determining influence of Indian Ocean SST on these changes. A suite of AGCM experiments, each consisting of a 10-member ensemble, is carried out to assess the relative importance of remote (Pacific) versus local (Indian Ocean) SST anomalies in determining precipitation anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean. Solutions indicate that both local and remote SST anomalies are necessary for realistic simulations with convection in the tropical west Pacific and the subsequent development of the South China Sea anticyclone being particularly sensitive to Indian Ocean SST anomalies. Prior to the climate shift, the basinwide Indian Ocean SST anomalies generate an atmospheric Kelvin wave associated with easterly flow over the equatorial west-central Pacific, thereby weakening the westerly anomalies associated with the developing El Ni (n) over tildeo. In contrast, after the shift, the east-west contrast in Indian Ocean SST anomalies does not generate a significant Kelvin wave response, and there is little effect on the El Ni (n) over tildeo-induced westerlies. The Linear Baroclinic Model (LBM) solutions confirm the AGCM's results.}},

  Abstract                 = {The array of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) prod- ucts now being derived from satellite imagery open up new opportunities for the study of short and long-term variability in climate. Using a time series analysis procedure based on the Principal Components transform, and a sequence of monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI imagery from 1986 through 1990, we examine trends in variability of vegetation greenness for Africa for evidence of climatic trends. ln addition to the anticipated seasonal trends, we identify signals of interannual variability. The most readily identified is one that periodically affects Southern Africa. It is shown that the temporal loadings for this component exhibit a very strong relationship with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index derived from atmospheric pressure patterns in the Pacific, Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, and with anomalous Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR). However, we have also detected a second interannual variation, affecting most particularly East Africa and the Sahel, that does not exhibit a consistent ENSO relationship. The results show the teleconnection patterns between climatic conditions in the Pacific Ocean basin and vegetation conditions at specific regional locations over Africa. The comprehensive spatial character and high temporal resolution of these data offer exciting prospects for deriving a land surface index of ENSO and mapping the impacts of ENSO activity at continental scale. This study illustrates that vegeta- tion reflectance data derived from polar orbiting satellites can serve as good proxy for the study of interannual climate variability.},

  abstract 				   = "Abstract Spatially high resolution climate information is required for a variety of applications in but not limited to functional biodiversity research. In order to scale the generally plot-based research fndings to a landscape level, spatial interpolation methods of meteorological variables are required. Based on a network of tempreature observation plots across the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the skill of 14 machine learning algorithms in predicting spatial temperature patterns is tested and evaluated against the heavily utilized kriging approach. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation testing design, regression trees generally perform better than linear and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by Cubist, random forest and model averaged neural networks which except for the latter are all regression tree-based algorithms. While these machine learning algorithms perform better than kriging in a quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the resulting air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist and residual kriging approach can be considered the best solution. "

  Abstract                 = {Climatic data are an essential input for the determination of crop water requirements. The density and location of weather stations are the important design variables for obtaining the required degree of accuracy of weather data. The planning of weather station networks should include economic considerations, and a mixture of full and partial weather stations could be a cost-effective alternative. A â€˜fullâ€™ weather station is defined here as one in which all the weather variables used in the modified Penman equation are measured, and a â€˜partialâ€™ weather station is one in which some, but not all, weather variables are measured. The accuracy of reference evapotranspiration (Etr) estimates for sites located some distance from surrounding stations is dependent on measurement error, error of the estimation equation, and interpolation error. The interpolation error is affected by the spatial correlation structure of weather variables and method of interpolation. A case-study data set of 2 years of daily climatic data (1989â€“1990) from 17 stations in the states of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado was used to compare alternative network designs and interpolation methods. Root mean squared interpolation error (RMSIE) values were the criteria for evaluating Etr estimates and network performance. The kriging method gave the lowest RMSIE, followed by the inverse distance square method and the inverse distance method. Co-kriging improved the estimates still further. For a given level of performance, a mixture of full and partial weather stations would be more economical than full stations only. },

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystems provide services necessary for the livelihoods and well-being of people. Quantifying and mapping supplies and demands of ecosystem services is essential for continuous monitoring of such services to support decision-making. Area-wide and spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services based on extensive ground surveys is restricted to local scales and limited due to high costs. In contrast, remote sensing provides reliable area-wide data for quantifying and mapping ecosystem services at comparatively low costs, and with the option of fast, frequent, and continuous observations for monitoring. In this paper, we review relevant remote sensing systems, sensor types, and methods applicable in quantifying selected provisioning and regulatory services. Furthermore, opportunities, challenges, and future prospects in using remote sensing for supporting ecosystem services' quantification and mapping are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Concern is growing about the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human well being. Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

We provide evidence that the anomalous 2010 warmth that caused adverse impacts exceeded the amplitude and spatial extent of the previous hottest summer of 2003. "Mega-heatwaves" such as the 2003 and 2010 events broke the 500-year-long seasonal temperature records over approximately 50\% of Europe. According to regional multi-model experiments, the probability of a summer experiencing "mega-heatwaves" will increase by a factor of 5 to 10 within the next 40 years. However, the magnitude of the 2010 event was so extreme that despite this increase, the occurrence of an analogue over the same region remains fairly unlikely until the second half of the 21st century.},

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity of the global atmospheric response to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies throughout the tropical Indian and Pacific Ocean basins is investigated using the NCEP MRF9 general circulation model (GCM). Model responses in January are first determined for a uniform array of 42 localized SST anomaly patches over the domain. Results from the individual forcing experiments are then linearly combined using a statistically based smoothing procedure to produce sensitivity maps for many target quantities of interest, in- cluding the geopotential height response over the Pacificâ€“North American (PNA) region and regional precipitation responses over North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and Indonesia. Perhaps the most striking result from this analysis is that many important targets for seasonal forecasting, including the PNA response, are most sensitive to SST anomalies in the Nin of the central tropical Pacific, with lesser and sometimes opposite sensitivities to SST anomalies in the Nin Ëœo-4 and -3 regions. region (5î€¸Nâ€“5î€¸S, 90î€¸â€“150î€¸W) of the eastern tropical Pacific. However, certain important targets, such as In- donesian rainfall, are most sensitive to SST anomalies outside both the Nin These results are also relevant in assessing atmospheric sensitivity to changes in tropical SSTs on decadal to centennial scales associated with natural as well as anthropogenic forcing. In this context it is interesting to note the surprising result that warm SST anomalies in one-third of the Indo-Pacific domain lead to a decrease of global mean precipitation.

Combination of the altimetry-based lake water volume with TWS from GRACE over the lakes drainage basins allows estimating soilmoisture and groundwater volumevariations.

  Abstract                 = {Biological soil crusts, a community of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses that live on the soil surface, occur in deserts throughout the world. They are a critical component of desert ecosystems, as they are important contributors to soil fertility and stability. Future climate scenarios predict alteration of the timing and amount of precipitation in desert environments. Because biological soil crust organisms are only metabolically active when wet, and as soil surfaces dry quickly in deserts during late spring, summer, and early fall, the amount and timing of precipitation is likely to have significant impacts on the physiological functioning of these communities. Using the three dominant soil crust types found in the western United States, we applied three levels of precipitation frequency (50\% below-average, average, and 50\% above-average) while maintaining average precipitation amount (therefore changing both timing and size of applied events). We measured the impact of these treatments on photosynthetic performance (as indicated by dark-adapted quantum yield and chlorophyll a concentrations), nitrogenase activity, and the ability of these organisms to maintain concentrations of radiation-protective pigments (scytonemin, beta-carotene, echinenone, xanthophylls, and canthaxanthin). Increased precipitation frequency produced little response after 2.5 months exposure during spring (1 April-15 June) or summer (15 June-31 August). In contrast, most of the above variables had a large, negative response after exposure to increased precipitation frequency for 6 months spring-fall (1 April-31 October) treatment. The crusts dominated by the soil lichen Collema, being dark and protruding above the surface, dried the most rapidly, followed by the dark surface cyanobacterial crusts (Nostoc- Scytonema- Microcoleus), and then by the light cyanobacterial crusts (Microcoleus). This order reflected the magnitude of the observed response: crusts dominated by the lichen Collema showed the largest decline in quantum yield, chlorophyll a, and protective pigments; crusts dominated by Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus showed an intermediate decline in these variables; and the crusts dominated by Microcoleus showed the least negative response. Most previous studies of crust response to radiation stress have been short-term laboratory studies, where organisms were watered and kept under moderate temperatures. Such conditions would give crust organisms access to ample carbon to respond to imposed stresses (e.g., production of UV-protective pigments, replacement of degraded chlorophyll). In contrast, our longer-term study showed that under field conditions of high air temperatures and frequent, small precipitation events, crust organisms appear unable to produce protective pigments in response to radiation stress, as they likely dried more quickly than when they received larger, less frequent events. Reduced activity time likely resulted in less carbon available to produce or repair chlorophyll a and/or protective pigments. Our findings may partially explain the global observation that soil lichen cover and richness declines as the frequency of summer rainfall increases.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the relationships between H2O and CO2 gas exchange parameters and leaf trichome cover in 12 species of Tillandsia that exhibit a wide range in trichome size and trichome cover. Previous investigations have hypothesized that trichomes function to enhance boundary layers around Tillandsioid leaves thereby buffering the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and retarding transpirational water loss. Data presented herein suggest that trichome-enhanced boundary layers have negligible effects on Tillandsia gas exchange, as indicated by the lack of statistically significant relationships in regression analyses of gas exchange parameters and trichome cover. We calculated trichome and leaf boundary layer components, and their associated effects on H2O and CO2 gas exchange. The results further indicate trichome-enhanced boundary layers do not significantly reduce transpirational water loss. We conclude that although the trichomes undoubtedly increase the thickness of the boundary layer, the increase due to Tillandsioid trichomes is inconsequential in terms of whole leaf boundary layers, and any associated reduction in transpirational water loss is also negligible within the whole plant gas exchange pathway.},

This study uses observational data to unravel the relationship between the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and rainy autumns in East Africa. Analysis of sea-surface temperature data shows that strong East African rainfall is associated with warming in the Pacific and Western Indian Oceans and cooling in the Eastern Indian Ocean. The resemblance of this pattern to that which develops during IOD events implies a link between the IOD and strong East African rainfall. Further investigation suggests that the observed teleconnection between East African rainfall and ENSO is a manifestation of a link between ENSO and the IOD.},

  Abstract                 = {The Tibetan plateau, like any landmass, emits energy into the atmosphere in the form of dry heat and water vapour, but its mean surface elevation is more than 5 km above sea level. This elevation is widely held to cause the plateau to serve as a heat source that drives the South Asian summer monsoon, potentially coupling uplift of the plateau to climate changes on geologic timescales. Observations of the present climate, however, do not clearly establish the Tibetan plateau as the dominant thermal forcing in the region: peak upper-tropospheric temperatures during boreal summer are located over continental India, south of the plateau. Here we show that, although Tibetan plateau heating locally enhances rainfall along its southern edge in an atmospheric model, the large-scale South Asian summer monsoon circulation is otherwise unaffected by removal of the plateau, provided that the narrow orography of the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges is preserved. Additional observational and model results suggest that these mountains produce a strong monsoon by insulating warm, moist air over continental India from the cold and dry extratropics. These results call for both a reinterpretation of how South Asian climate may have responded to orographic uplift, and a re-evaluation of how this climate may respond to modified land surface and radiative forcings in coming decades.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to study the matrilineal genetic composition in Cabo Verde (Republic of Cape Verde), an archipelago that used to serve as a Portuguese entrep\^{o}t of the Atlantic slave trade, we have analysed a total of 292 mtDNAs sampled from the seven inhabited islands for the hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) and some characteristic RFLPs of the coding regions. The different settlement history of the northwestern group of the islands is well reflected in the mtDNA pool. The total Cabo Verde sample clearly displays the characteristic mitochondrial features of the Atlantic fringe of western Africa and testifies to almost no mitochondrial input from the Portuguese colonizers.},

  Abstract                 = {The inter-annual and spatial variability of different rainfall variables is analysed over Equatorial East Africa (Kenya and northeastern Tanzania). At the station level, three variables are considered: the total precipitation amount (P), the number of rain days (NRD) and the daily rainfall intensity (INT). Using a network of 34 stations, inter-station correlations (1958â€“1987) are computed for each of these variables. The spatial coherence of monthly or seasonal P and NRD is always much higher than that of rainfall intensity. However, large variations in spatial coherence are found in the course of the seasonal cycle. Coherence is highest at the peak of the short rains (Octoberâ€“December) and low during the long rains (Marchâ€“May), except at its beginning. The inter-annual variability of the onset and cessation of the rains is next considered, at the regional scale, and the study extended to 2001. In the long rains, the onset and cessation dates are independent of NRD and INT during the rainy season. Hence, the long rains seasonal rainfall total depends on a combination of virtually unrelated factors, which may account for the difficulty in its prediction. However, the onset, which exhibits a large inter-annual variability and a strong spatial coherence, has a prime role. Conversely, in the short rains, though the onset is again more decisive than the cessation, the different intra-seasonal descriptors of the rains are more strongly inter-related.},

  Abstract                 = {Current methods for large-scale vegetation monitoring rely on multispectral remote sensing, which has serious limitation for the detection of vegetation stress. To contribute to the establishment of a generalized spectral approach for vegetation stress detection, this study compares the ability of high-spectral-resolution reflectance (R) and fluorescence (F) foliar measurements to detect vegetation changes associated with common environmental factors affecting plant growth and productivity. To obtain a spectral dataset from a broad range of species and stress conditions, plant material from three experiments was examined, including (i) corn, nitrogen (N) deficiency/excess; (ii) soybean, elevated carbon dioxide, and ozone levels; and (iii) red maple, augmented ultraviolet irradiation. Fluorescence and R spectra (400-800 nm) were measured on the same foliar samples in conjunction with photosynthetic pigments, carbon, and N content. For separation of a wide range of treatment levels, hyperspectral (5-10 nm) R indices were superior compared with F or broadband R indices, with the derivative parameters providing optimal results. For the detection of changes in vegetation physiology, hyperspectral indices can provide a significant improvement over broadband indices. The relationship of treatment levels to R was linear, whereas that to F was curvilinear. Using reflectance measurements, it was not possible to identify the unstressed vegetation condition, which was accomplished in all three experiments using F indices. Large-scale monitoring of vegetation condition and the detection of vegetation stress could be improved by using hyperspectral R and F information, a possible strategy for future remote sensing missions.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric circulation anomalies, related to snowfall events on the Tanzanian volcano Kilimanjaro, were analyzed based on hourly snowfall data from an automated weather station (AWS), global precipitation and reanalysis prod- ucts. Analysis of 5 years of data (2000â€“2005) shows that snowfall on Kilimanjaro is linked to large-scale circulation anomalies, which can be identified in global reanalysis products. During the long rains season (Marchâ€“May) snow- fall on Kilimanjaro is associated with a west to east propa- gating wave of convective activity, which over East Africa merges with a precipitation-band maintained by steady easterly moisture influx due to cyclonic activity over north- ern Madagascar. Snowfall events tend to be associated with low wind speed, favorable for the development of surface radiative heating, thereby destabilizing the atmospheric col- umn and initiating upward motion and deep convection. High near-surface specific humidity provides the necessary water vapor so that convection becomes moist. The short rains season (Octoberâ€“December) is dominated by east to west moisture transport. This easterly flow extends vertical- ly through much of the troposphere and horizontally from the western Indian Ocean westward across the African con- tinent. An active center of vertical motion and deep con- vection located over the western Indian Ocean near the East African coastline is responsible for easterly moisture transport and spill-over of precipitation into the East African domain. During positive phases of the Indian Ocean Zonal Mode (IOZM) strong trade winds prevail across the Indian Ocean, which, in combination with enhanced westerlies over the continental interior, tend to enhance low-level wind and moisture convergence near Kilimanjaro. During the negative IOZM phase on the other hand, the trade winds across the Indian Ocean and the westerly flow from the Atlantic Ocean are weaker, moisture convergence is reduced and conditions to initiate deep convection over Kilimanjaro are generally less favorable.},

Analysis of 5 years of data (2000â€“2005) shows that snowfall on Kilimanjaro is linked to large-scale circulation anomalies, which can be identified in global reanalysis products. During the long rains season (Marchâ€“May) snow- fall on Kilimanjaro is associated with a west to east propa- gating wave of convective activity, which over East Africa merges with a precipitation-band maintained by steady easterly moisture influx due to cyclonic activity over north- ern Madagascar. Snowfall events tend to be associated with low wind speed, favorable for the development of surface radiative heating, thereby destabilizing the atmospheric col- umn and initiating upward motion and deep convection. High near-surface specific humidity provides the necessary water vapor so that convection becomes moist. The short rains season (Octoberâ€“December) is dominated by east to west moisture transport. This easterly flow extends vertical- ly through much of the troposphere and horizontally from the western Indian Ocean westward across the African con- tinent. An active center of vertical motion and deep con- vection located over the western Indian Ocean near the East African coastline is responsible for easterly moisture transport and spill-over of precipitation into the East African domain. During positive phases of the Indian Ocean Zonal Mode (IOZM) strong trade winds prevail across the Indian Ocean, which, in combination with enhanced westerlies over the continental interior, tend to enhance low-level wind and moisture convergence near Kilimanjaro. During the negative IOZM phase on the other hand, the trade winds across the Indian Ocean and the westerly flow from the Atlantic Ocean are weaker, moisture convergence is reduced and conditions to initiate deep convection over Kilimanjaro are generally less favorable.},

  Abstract                 = {{A baseline climatology is required in evaluating climate variability and changes on regional and local scales. Gridded climate normals, i.e. averages over a 30-year period, are of special interest since they can be readily used for validation of climate models. This study is aimed at creating an updated gridded dataset for Swedish monthly temperature normals over the period 1971-2000, based on standard 2-m air temperature records at 510 stations in mainland Sweden. Spatial trends of the normal temperatures were modelled as functions of latitude, longitude and elevation by multiple linear regression. The study shows that the temperature normals are strongly correlated with latitude throughout the year and especially in cold months, while elevation was a more important factor in June and July. Longitude played a minor role and was only significant in April and May. Regression equations linking temperature to latitude, longitude and elevation were set up for each month. Monthly temperature normals were detrended by subtracting spatial trends given by the regressions. Ordinary kriging was then applied to both original data (simple method) and detrended data (composite method) to model the spatial variability and to perform spatial gridding. The multiple regressions showed that between 82\% (summer) and 96\% (winter) of the variance in monthly temperature normals could be explained by latitude and elevation. Unexplained variances, i.e. the residuals, were modelled with ordinary kriging with exponential semivariograms. The composite grid estimates were calculated by adding the multiple linear trends back to the interpolated residuals at each grid point. Kriged original temperature normals provided a performance benchmark. The cross-validation shows that the interpolation errors of the normals are significantly reduced if the composite method rather than the simple one was used. A gridded monthly dataset with 30-arcsecond spacing was created using the established trends, the kriging model and a digital topographic dataset.}},

  Abstract                 = {Forests provide multiple benefits at local to global scales. These include the global public good of carbon sequestration and local and national level contributions to livelihoods for more than half a billion users. Forest commons are a particularly important class of forests generating these multiple benefits. Institutional arrangements to govern forest commons are believed to substantially influence carbon storage and livelihood contributions, especially when they incorporate local knowledge and decentralized decision making. However, hypothesized relationships between institutional factors and multiple benefits have never been tested on data from multiple countries. By using original data on 80 forest commons in 10 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we show that larger forest size and greater rule-making autonomy at the local level are associated with high carbon storage and livelihood benefits; differences in ownership of forest commons are associated with trade-offs between livelihood benefits and carbon storage. We argue that local communities restrict their consumption of forest products when they own forest commons, thereby increasing carbon storage. In showing rule-making autonomy and ownership as distinct and important institutional influences on forest outcomes, our results are directly relevant to international climate change mitigation initiatives such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and avoided deforestation. Transfer of ownership over larger forest commons patches to local communities, coupled with payments for improved carbon storage can contribute to climate change mitigation without adversely affecting local livelihoods.},

  Abstract                 = {Regularly updated land cover information at continental or national scales is a requirement for various land management applications as well as biogeochemical and climate modeling exercises. However, monitoring or updating of map products with sufficient spatial detail is currently not widely practiced due to inadequate time-series coverage for most regions of the Earth. Classifications of coarser spatial resolution data can be automatically generated on an annual or finer time scale. However, discrete land cover classifications of such data cannot sufficiently quantify land surface heterogeneity or change. This study presents a methodology for continuous and discrete land cover mapping using moderate spatial resolution time series data sets. The method automatically selects sample data from higher spatial resolution maps and generates multiple decision trees. The leaves of decision trees are interpreted considering the sample distribution of all classes yielding class membership maps, which can be used as estimates for the diversity of classes in a coarse resolution cell. Results are demonstrated for the heterogeneous, small-patch landscape of Germany and the bio-climatically varying landscape of South Africa. Results have overall classification accuracies of 80\%. A sensitivity analysis of individual modules of the classification process indicates the importance of appropriately chosen features, sample data balanced among classes, and an appropriate method to combine individual classifications. The comparison of classification results over several years not only indicates the method's consistency, but also its potential to detect land cover changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Production and consumption processes in soils contribute to the global cycles of many trace gases (CH4, CO, OCS, H2, N2O, and NO) that are relevant for atmospheric chemistry and climate. Soil microbial processes contribute substantially to the budgets of atmospheric trace gases. The flux of trace gases between soil and atmosphere is usually the result of simultaneously operating production and consumption processes in soil: The relevant processes are not yet proven with absolute certainty, but the following are likely for trace gas consumption: H2 oxidation by abiontic soil enzymes; CO cooxidation by the ammonium monooxygenase of nitrifying bacteria; CH4 oxidation by unknown methanotrophic bacteria that utilize CH4 for growth; OCS hydrolysis by bacteria containing carbonic anhydrase; N2O reduction to N2 by denitrifying bacteria; NO consumption by either reduction to N2O in denitrifiers or oxidation to nitrate in heterotrophic bacteria. Wetland soils, in contrast to upland soils are generally anoxic and thus support the production of trace gases (H2, CO, CH4, N2O, and NO) by anaerobic bacteria such as fermenters, methanogens, acetogens, sulfate reducers, and denitrifiers. Methane is the dominant gaseous product of anaerobic degradation of organic matter and is released into the atmosphere, whereas the other trace gases are only intermediates, which are mostly cycled within the anoxic habitat. A significant percentage of the produced methane is oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria at anoxic-oxic interfaces such as the soil surface and the root surface of aquatic plants that serve as conduits for O2 transport into and CH4 transport out of the wetland soils. The dominant production processes in upland soils are different from those in wetland soils and include H2 production by biological N2 fixation, CO production by chemical decomposition of soil organic matter, and NO and N2O production by nitrification and denitrification. The processes responsible for CH4 production in upland soils are completely unclear, as are the OCS production processes in general. A problem for future research is the attribution of trace gas metabolic processes not only to functional groups of microorganisms but also to particular taxa. Thus, it is completely unclear how important microbial diversity is for the control of trace gas flux at the ecosystem level. However, different microbial communities may be part of the reason for differences in trace gas metabolism, e.g., effects of nitrogen fertilizers on CH4 uptake by soil; decrease of CH4 production with decreasing temperature; or different rates and modes of NO and N2O production in different soils and under different conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The ocean surface boundary layer mediates air-sea exchange. In the classical paradigm and in current climate models, its turbulence is driven by atmospheric forcing. Observations at a 1-km-wide front within the Kuroshio found the rate of energy dissipation within the boundary layer to be enhanced by 10 to 20 times, suggesting that the front not the atmospheric forcing supplied the energy for the turbulence. The data quantitatively support the hypothesis that winds aligned with the frontal velocity catalyzed a release of energy from the front to the turbulence. The resulting boundary layer is stratified, in contrast to the classically well-mixed layer. These effects will be strongest at the intense fronts found in the Kuroshio, Gulf Stream, and Antarctic Circumpolar Current, key players in the climate system.},

  Abstract                 = {Around the world, leaders are increasingly recognizing ecosystems as natural capital assets that supply life-support services of tremendous value. The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Two satellite rainfall estimation algorithms, CMORPH and TMPA, are evaluated over two mountainous regions at daily accumulation and spatial resolution 0.25. The evaluated TMPA products are TRMM-3B42 and TRMM-3B42RT. The first of the two validations region is located over the Ethiopian highlands in the Horn of Africa. The second is located over the highlands of Columbia in South America. Both sites are characterized by a very complex terrain. Relatively dense station networks over the two sites are used to validate the satellite products. The correlation coefficients between the reference gauge data and the satellite products were found to be low. Besides, the products underestimate both the occurrence and amount of rainfall over both validation sites. These were attributed, at least partly, to orographic warm rain process over the two regions. The performance over Colombia was better compared to that for Ethiopia. And CMORPH has exhibited better performance as compared to the two TRMM products.},

  Abstract                 = {We model future changes in land biogeochemistry and biogeography across East Africa. East Africa is one of few tropical regions where general circulation model (GCM) future climate projections exhibit a robust response of strong future warming and general annual-mean rainfall increases. Eighteen future climate projections from nine GCMs participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assess- ment were used as input to the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), which predicted vegetation patterns and carbon storage in agreement with satellite observations and forest inventory data under the present-day climate. All simulations showed future increases in tropical woody vegetation over the region at the expense of grasslands. Regional increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (18â€“36\%) and total carbon storage (3â€“13\%) by 2080â€“2099 compared with the present-day were common to all simulations. Despite decreases in soil carbon after 2050, seven out of nine simulations continued to show an annual net land carbon sink in the final decades of the 21st century because vegetation biomass continued to increase. The seasonal cycles of rainfall and soil moisture show future increases in wet season rainfall across the GCMs with generally little change in dry season rainfall. Based on the simulated present-day climate and its future trends, the GCMs can be grouped into four broad categories. Overall, our model results suggest that East Africa, a populous and economically poor region, is likely to experience some ecosystem service benefits through increased precipitation, river runoff and fresh water availability. Resulting enhancements in NPP may lead to improved crop yields in some areas. Our results stand in partial contradiction to other studies that suggest possible negative consequences for agriculture, biodiversity and other ecosystem services caused by temperature increases.},

  Abstract                 = {Hourly temperature and humidity observations were obtained over 16 months from loggers ranging in elevation from 1890 to 5800 m a.s.l. up the southwestern slope of Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. The vertical gradient in mean air temperature is non-linear, with the treeline weakening the gradient and the snow-ice line enhancing it. On average, moisture availability (both relative humidity and absolute vapor pressure) decreases with elevation, but the seasonal and diurnal variability in relative humidity (RH) is enhanced toward the mountain summit. The strong diurnal cycle in humidity is shown to be an outcome of strong upslope moisture transport during the day, counterbalanced by downslope transport and drying at night. Cooling on the lower slopes during the months of June and July weakens the lapse rates and consequently convective activity. This is borne out by the reduction in cloud amounts (using a surrogate threshold of RH . 95\%), toward the summit during these months. The lower slopes of Kilimanjaro are observed to be a major moisture source for the summit region, and implications of this for the mass balance of the summit glaciers are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes and typhoons) are now believed to be an important component of the Earth's climate system. In particular, by vigorously mixing the upper ocean, they can affect the ocean's heat uptake, poleward heat transport, and hence global temperatures. Changes in the distribution and frequency of tropical cyclones could therefore become an important element of the climate response to global warming. A potential analogue to modern greenhouse conditions, the climate of the early Pliocene epoch (approximately 5 to 3 million years ago) can provide important clues to this response. Here we describe a positive feedback between hurricanes and the upper-ocean circulation in the tropical Pacific Ocean that may have been essential for maintaining warm, El Ni\~{n}o-like conditions during the early Pliocene. This feedback is based on the ability of hurricanes to warm water parcels that travel towards the Equator at shallow depths and then resurface in the eastern equatorial Pacific as part of the ocean's wind-driven circulation. In the present climate, very few hurricane tracks intersect the parcel trajectories; consequently, there is little heat exchange between waters at such depths and the surface. More frequent and/or stronger hurricanes in the central Pacific imply greater heating of the parcels, warmer temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific, warmer tropics and, in turn, even more hurricanes. Using a downscaling hurricane model, we show dramatic shifts in the tropical cyclone distribution for the early Pliocene that favour this feedback. Further calculations with a coupled climate model support our conclusions. The proposed feedback should be relevant to past equable climates and potentially to contemporary climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies suggest that species distribution models (SDMs) based on fine-scale climate data may provide markedly different estimates of climate-change impacts than coarse-scale models. However, these studies disagree in their conclusions of how scale influences projected species distributions. In rugged terrain, coarse-scale climate grids may not capture topographically controlled climate variation at the scale that constitutes microhabitat or refugia for some species. Although finer scale data are therefore considered to better reflect climatic conditions experienced by species, there have been few formal analyses of how modeled distributions differ with scale. We modeled distributions for 52 plant species endemic to the California Floristic Province of different life forms and range sizes under recent and future climate across a 2000-fold range of spatial scales (0.008-16Â km(2) ). We produced unique current and future climate datasets by separately downscaling 4 km climate models to three finer resolutions based on 800, 270, and 90Â m digital elevation models and deriving bioclimatic predictors from them. As climate-data resolution became coarser, SDMs predicted larger habitat area with diminishing spatial congruence between fine- and coarse-scale predictions. These trends were most pronounced at the coarsest resolutions and depended on climate scenario and species' range size. On average, SDMs projected onto 4 km climate data predicted 42\% more stable habitat (the amount of spatial overlap between predicted current and future climatically suitable habitat) compared with 800Â m data. We found only modest agreement between areas predicted to be stable by 90 m models generalized to 4 km grids compared with areas classified as stable based on 4Â km models, suggesting that some climate refugia captured at finer scales may be missed using coarser scale data. These differences in projected locations of habitat change may have more serious implications than net habitat area when predictive maps form the basis of conservation decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {Since 1980, the number of undernourished people in eastern and southern Africa has more than doubled. Rural development stalled and rural poverty expanded during the 1990s. Population growth remains very high, and declining per-capita agricultural capacity retards progress toward Millennium Development goals. Analyses of in situ station data and satellite observations of precipitation have identified another problematic trend: main growing-season rainfall receipts have diminished by â‰ˆ15% in food-insecure countries clustered along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. Occurring during the main growing seasons in poor countries dependent on rain-fed agriculture, these declines are societally dangerous. Will they persist or intensify? Tracing moisture deficits upstream to an anthropogenically warming Indian Ocean leads us to conclude that further rainfall declines are likely. We present analyses suggesting that warming in the central Indian Ocean ! disrupts onshore moisture transports, reducing continental rainfall. Thus, late 20th-century anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming has probably already produced societally dangerous climate change by creating drought and social disruption in some of the world's most fragile food economies. We quantify the potential impacts of the observed precipitation and agricultural capacity trends by modeling â€œmillions of undernourished peopleâ€? as a function of rainfall, population, cultivated area, seed, and fertilizer use. Persistence of current tendencies may result in a 50% increase in undernourished people by 2030. On the other hand, modest increases in per-capita agricultural productivity could more than offset the observed precipitation declines. Investing in agricultural development can help mitigate climate change while decreasing rural poverty and vulnerability.},

  Abstract                 = {The Socotra Archipelago is an ancient continental fragment of Gondwanan origin and one of the most isolated landforms on Earth and a biodiversity hot spot. Yet, the biogeography and evolutionary history of its endemic fauna still remain largely overlooked. We investigate the origin, tempo and mode of diversification in the Hemidactylus geckos of the Socotra Archipelago. Concatenated and multilocus species coalescent analyses of Hemidactylus from Arabia and North Africa indicate that the Hemidactylus from Socotra do not form a monophyletic group and branch as three independent and well-supported clades instead. Both the chronogram inferred using the gene tree approach of BEAST and the age-calibrated multilocus species tree obtained using *BEAST suggest that the origin of Hemidactylus from Socotra may have involved a first vicariance event that occurred in the Early Miocene, followed by two independent transoceanic dispersal events that occurred more recently, during the Pliocene. Within Socotra, we analysed patterns of genetic diversity, the phylogeography and the demographic history in all seven nonintroduced species of Hemidactylus. Results based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear loci from 144 individuals revealed complex patterns of within-island diversification and high levels of intra-species genetic divergence. The interplay of both historical and ecological factors seems to have a role in the speciation process of this group of geckos. Interestingly, the case of H. forbesii and H. oxyrhinus, which inhabit the island of Abd al Kuri with an area of 133 km(2), may represent one of the most extreme cases of intra-island speciation in reptiles ever reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high. The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: This systematic literature review aims to identify documented impacts that windstorms have on human health. Windstorms occur frequently and some researchers have predicted an increase in severe gales in the future, resulting in an urgent need to understand the related patterns of morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: A systematic literature review of international evidence on the impacts of windstorms on human health was conducted in May 2012. RESULTS: This review of published evidence demonstrates that human health can be severely affected by windstorms. Direct effects occur during the impact phase of a storm, causing death and injury due to the force of the wind. Becoming airborne, being struck by flying debris or falling trees and road traffic accidents are the main dangers. Indirect effects, occurring during the pre- and post-impact phases of the storm, include falls, lacerations and puncture wounds, and occur when preparing for, or cleaning up after a storm. Power outages are a key issue and can lead to electrocution, fires and burns and carbon monoxide poisoning from gasoline powered electrical generators. Additionally, worsening of chronic illnesses due to lack of access to medical care or medication can occur. Other health impacts include infections and insect bites. CONCLUSION: Public health advice can reduce morbidity and mortality from windstorms. Findings from this review will provide material for increased awareness and education amongst the public and healthcare professionals to prevent and prepare for these health impacts. Nevertheless, more research is needed to identify more specific patterns of health impacts and how these could be reduced in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystem service approaches to conservation are being championed as a new strategy for conservation, under the hypothesis that they will broaden and deepen support for biodiversity protection. Where traditional approaches focus on setting aside land by purchasing property rights, ecosystem service approaches aim to engage a much wider range of places, people, policies, and financial resources in conservation. This is particularly important given projected intensification of human impacts, with rapid growth in population size and individual aspirations. Here we use field research on 34 ecosystem service (ES) projects and 26 traditional biodiversity (BD) projects from the Western Hemisphere to test whether ecosystem service approaches show signs of realizing their putative potential. We find that the ES projects attract on average more than four times as much funding through greater corporate sponsorship and use of a wider variety of finance tools than BD projects. ES projects are also more likely to encompass working landscapes and the people in them. We also show that, despite previous concern, ES projects not only expand opportunities for conservation, but they are no less likely than BD projects to include or create protected areas. Moreover, they do not draw down limited financial resources for conservation but rather engage a more diverse set of funders. We also found, however, that monitoring of conservation outcomes in both cases is so infrequent that it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of either ES or BD approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {{A 1 km(2) resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of Ireland was constructed and used as the basis for generating digital maps of the climate parameters required to run a model of ecosystem carbon and water cycling. The DEM had mean absolute errors of 30 m or less for most of Ireland. The ecosystem model requires inputs of monthly precipitation, monthly averaged maximum and minimum daily temperature, and monthly averaged daily solar radiation. Long-term (1951 to 1980) averaged monthly data were obtained from sites measuring precipitation (618 sites), temperature (62 sites), and the number of hours of bright sunshine per day ('sunshine hours') (61 sites). Polynomial regression was used to derive a simple model for each monthly climate variable to relate climate to position and elevation on the DEM. Accuracy assessments with subsets of each climate data set determined that polynomial regression can predict average monthly climate in Ireland with mean absolute errors of 5 to 15 mm for monthly precipitation, 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C for monthly averaged maximum and minimum temperature, and 6 to 15 min for monthly averaged sunshine hours. The polynomial regression estimates of climate were compared with estimates from a modified inverse-distance-squared interpolation. Prediction accuracy did not differ between the 2 methods, but the polynomial regression models demanded less time to generate and less computer storage space, greatly decreasing the time required for regional modeling runs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents three multivariate geostatistical algorithms for incorporating a digital elevation model into the spatial prediction of rainfall: simple kriging with varying local means; kriging with an external drift; and colocated cokriging. The techniques are illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 36 climatic stations in a 5000 km(2) region of Portugal. Cross validation is used to compare the prediction performances of the three geostatistical interpolation algorithms with the straightforward linear regression of rainfall against elevation and three univariate techniques: the Thiessen polygon, inverse square distance; and ordinary kriging. Larger prediction errors are obtained for the two algorithms (inverse square distance, Thiessen polygon) that ignore both the elevation and rainfall records at surrounding stations. The three multivariate geostatistical algorithms outperform other interpolators, in particular the linear regression, which stresses the importance of accounting for spatially dependent rainfall observations in addition to the colocated elevation. Last, ordinary kriging yields more accurate predictions than linear regression when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate (less than 0.75 in the case study).

  Abstract                 = {World food demand is expected to more than double by 2050. Decisions about how to meet this challenge will have profound effects on wild species and habitats. We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.},

  Abstract                 = {Pollen data collected in Africa at high (Ku- ruyange, valley swamp, Burundi) and low altitude (Victoria, lake, Uganda; Ngamakala, pond, Congo) showed that after 6 ky before present (BP), pollen of deciduous trees increase their relative percentage, suggesting thus the reduction of the annual amount of precipitation and/or an increase of in the length of the dry season. Until now, pollen-climate trans- fer functions only investigated mean annual precipitation, due to the absence of modern pollen-assemblage analogs un- der diversified precipitation regimes. Hence these functions omit the potential effect of a change in precipitation season- ality modifying thus the length of the dry season. In the present study, we use an equilibrium biosphere model (i.e. BIOME3.5) to estimate the sensitivity of equatorial African vegetation, at specific sites, to such changes. Climatic sce- narios, differing only in the monthly distribution of the cur- rent annual amount of precipitation, are examined at the above three locations in equatorial Africa. Soil characteris- tics, monthly temperatures and cloudiness are kept constant at their present-day values. Good agreement is shown be- tween model simulations and current biomes assemblages, as inferred from pollen data. To date, the increase of the de- ciduous forest component in the palaeodata around 6 kyBP has been interpreted as the beginning of a drier climate pe- riod. However, our results demonstrate that a change in the seasonal distribution of precipitation could also induce the observed changes in vegetation types. This study confirms the importance of taking into account seasonal changes in the hydrological balance. Palaeoecologists can greatly ben- efit from the use of dynamic process based vegetation models to acccount for modification of the length of the dry sea- son when they wish to reconstruct vegetation composition or to infer quantitative climate parameters, such as temperature and precipitation, from pollen or vegetation proxy.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past, many algorithms have been applied for three-dimensional (3-D) single tree extraction using Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data. Clustering based algorithms are widely used in different applications but rarely being they used in the field of forestry using ALS data as an input. In this paper, a comparative qualitative study was conducted using the iterative partitioning and hierarchical clustering based mechanisms and full waveform ALS data as an input to extract the individual trees/tree crowns in their most appropriate shape. The full waveform LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data was collected from the Waldkirch black forest area in the south-western part of Germany in August 2005 with density of 4â€“5 points/m2. Both the clustering algorithms were used in their original and modified form for a comparative qualitative analysis of the results obtained in the form of individual clusters containing 3-D points for each tree/tree crown. A total of 378 trees were found in all the 1.2 ha area with height ranging from 15 m to 50.9 m. The forest contains mainly older trees with deciduous, coniferous and mixed stands. The findings showed that among the three kind of clustering methods applied (normal k-means, modified k-means and hierarchical clustering), the modified k-means algorithm using external seed points and scaling down the height for initialization of the clustering process was the most promising method for the extraction of clusters of individual trees/tree crowns. A 3-D reconstruction of extracted individual clusters was carried out using QHull algorithm. In this study, the result was not possible to validate quantitatively due to lack of the field inventory data.},

  Abstract                 = {Land-cover is an important parameter in analyzing the state and dynamics of natural and anthropogenic terrestrial ecosystems. Land-cover classes related to semi-arid savannas currently exhibit among the greatest uncertainties in available global land cover datasets. This study focuses on the Kalahari in northeastern Namibia and compares the effects of different composite lengths and observation periods with class-wise mapping accuracies derived from multi-temporal MODIS time series classifications to better understand and overcome quality gaps in mapping semi-arid land-cover types. We further assess the effects of precipitation patterns on mapping accuracy using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observation data. Botanical field samples, translated into the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), were used for training and validation. Different sets of composites (16-day to three-monthly) were generated from MODIS (MOD13Q1) data covering the sample period from 2004 to 2007. Land-cover classifications were performed cumulatively based on annual and inter-annual feature sets with the use of random forests. Woody vegetation proved to be more stable in terms of omission and commission errors compared to herbaceous vegetation types. Generally, mapping accuracy increases with increasing length of the observation period. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) verified that inter-annual classifications significantly improved class-wise mapping accuracies, and confirmed that monthly composites achieved the best accuracy scores for both annual and inter-annual classifications. Correlation analyses using piecewise linear models affirmed positive correlations between cumulative mapping accuracy and rainfall and indicated an influence of seasonality and environmental cues on the mapping accuracies. The consideration of the inter-seasonal variability of vegetation activity and phenology cycling in the classification process further increases the overall classification performance of savanna classes in large-area land-cover datasets. Implications for global monitoring frameworks are discussed based on a conceptual model of the relationship between observation period and accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), the aggregate impact of land use on biomass available each year in ecosystems, is a prominent measure of the human domination of the biosphere. We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and forestry statistics, and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15.6 Pg C/yr or 23.8\% of potential net primary productivity, of which 53\% was contributed by harvest, 40\% by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7\% by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being. The results suggest that large-scale schemes to substitute biomass for fossil fuels should be viewed cautiously because massive additional pressures on ecosystems might result from increased biomass harvest.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemics of malaria in the East African highlands in the last 2 decades have often been associated with climate variability, particularly the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, there are other factors associated with malaria risk and there is increased interest in the influences of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a climate mode of coupled ocean-atmosphere variability, on East African rainfall. This study explores the relationship between IOD and the number of malaria patients in 7 hospitals from 2 districts in the western Kenyan highlands, controlling for the effects of ENSO. We examined temporal patterns (1982-2001) in the number of malaria cases in relation to the dipole mode index (DMI), defined as the difference in sea surface temperature anomaly between the western (10 degrees S-10 degrees N, 50 degrees-70 degrees E) and eastern (10 degrees S-0 degrees, 90 degrees-110 degrees E) tropical Indian Ocean. We used Poisson regression models, adjusted for ENSO index Ni\~{n}o 3 region (NINO3), seasonal and interannual variations. The number of malaria patients per month increased by 3.4\%-17.9\% for each 0.1 increase above a DMI threshold (3-4 months lag). Malaria cases increased by 1.4\%-10.7\% per month, for each 10 mm increase in monthly rainfall (2-3 months lag). In 6 of 7 places, there was no evidence of an association between NINO3 and the number of malaria cases after adjusting for the effect of DMI. This study suggests that the number of malaria cases in the western Kenyan highlands increases with high DMI in the months preceding hospital visits.},

The long-term mean upper-tropospheric circulation is dominated in boreal winter by divergent outflow from the southern Indian Ocean northwestward into southern Asia, and in summer from southern Asia southwestward into the Southern Hemisphere. In boreal autumn only, divergent easterlies blow from Indonesia along the equator into an uppertropospheric convergence band over East Africa, and only then a closed zonal-vertical circulation cell materializes along the Indian Ocean equator, between the centers of ascending motion over Indonesia and of subsidence over equatorial East Africa, and featuring westerlies in the lower layers. The boreal autumn zonal-vertical circulation varies interannually. A regime of intense circulation features accelerated equatorial surface westerlies, enhanced subsidence, and deficient rainfall at the coast of East Africa. Tn the high phase of the Southern Oscillation {[}anomalously high (low) pressure at Tahiti (Darwin)] this regime is preferred. The regime of weak zonal circulation has the opposite departure characteristics.}},

  Abstract                 = {Equatorial glaciers are particularly climate sensitive components of the environment and their area shrinkage is spectacular, but the quantitative appraisal of climatic forcing requires information on net balance and changing ice thickness. Unique in the tropical belt, observations of mass budget and surface topography have been gathered by decades- long monitoring on Mount Kenya, particularly its largest, the Lewis Glacier. More limited information on ice thickness change is available for the summit of Kilimanjaro. Sensitivity analyses with constant precipitation, net allwave radiation and relative humidity serve to explore the sensible and latent heat transfer processes; humidity change riding on that of temperature providing the more substantial energy contribution to ablation. For Lewis Glacier it is found that with air some 0.7 Â°C cooler the mass budget could reach equilibrium. Observations on the secular evolution of air temperature and humidity in the areas of Mount Kenya and Rwenzori show compatible magnitudes, although contribution by radiative forcing cannot be excluded. For the summit of Kilimanjaro, above the mean freezing level, where ablation is limited to sublimation, turbulent heat transfer processes associated with temperature differences cannot account for the imbalance of the mass budget, and solar radiation forcing continues to be important for both the ice thinning and the lateral retreat of ice cliffs.

  Abstract                 = {{The public health and economic consequences of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are once again regarded as priorities for global development. There has been much speculation on whether anthropogenic climate change is exacerbating the malaria problem, especially in areas of high altitude where P. falciparum transmission is limited by low temperature(1-4). The International Panel on Climate Change has concluded that there is likely to be a net extension in the distribution of malaria and an increase in incidence within this range(5). We investigated long-term meteorological trends in four high-altitude sites in East Africa, where increases in malaria have been reported in the past two decades. Here we show that temperature, rainfall, vapour pressure and the number of months suitable for P. falciparum transmission have not changed significantly during the past century or during the period of reported malaria resurgence. A high degree of temporal and spatial variation in the climate of East Africa suggests further that claimed associations between local malaria resurgences and regional changes in climate are overly simplistic.}},

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity loss can affect ecosystem functions and services. Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

The vegetation of the so-called Chagga homegardens belongs floristically to the formation of ruderal vegetation forming two main communities that are determined by altitude. These coffee-banana plantations maintain a high biodiversity with about 520 vascular plant species including over 400 non-cultivated plants. Most species (194) occurring in the Chagga homegardens are forest species, followed by 128 ruderal species, including 41 neophytes. Typical of the agroforestry system of the Chagga homegardens is their multilayered vegetation structure similar to a tropical montane forest with trees, shrubs, lianas, epiphytes and herbs. Beside relicts of the former forest cover, which lost most of their former habitats, there are on the other hand (apophytic) forest species, which were directly or indirectly favoured by the land use of the Chagga people. High demand of wood, the introduction of coffee varieties that are sun-tolerant and low coffee prizes on the world marked endanger this effective and sustainable system.}},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud forests are of great importance in the hydrological functioning of watersheds in subhumid East Africa. How- ever, the montane forests of Mt. Kilimanjaro are heavily threatened by global change impacts. Based on an evalu- ation of over 1500 vegetation plots and interpretation of satellite imagery from 1976 and 2000, land-cover changes on Kilimanjaro were evaluated and their impact on the water balance estimated. While the vanishing glaciers of Kilimanjaro attract broad interest, the associated increase of frequency and intensity of fires on the slopes of Kili- manjaro is less conspicuous but ecologically far more sig- nificant. These climate change-induced fires have lead to changes in species composition and structure of the forests and to a downward shift of the upper forest line by several hundred metres. During the last 70 years, Kilimanjaro has lost nearly one-third of its forest cover, in the upper areas caused by fire, on the lower forest border mainly caused by clearing. The loss of 150 km2 of cloud forest â€“ the most effective source in the upper montane and subalpine fog interception zone â€“ caused by fire during the last three decades means a considerable reduction in water yield. In contrast to common belief, global warming does not nec- essarily cause upward migration of plants and animals. On Kilimanjaro the opposite trend is under way, with conse- quences more harmful than those due to the loss of the showy ice cap of Africaâ€™s highest mountain.},

  Abstract                 = {The global savanna biome is characterized by enormous diversity in the physiognomy and spatial structure of the vegetation. The foliage clumping index can be calculated from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. It measures the response of the darkspot reflectance to increased shadow associated with clumped vegetation and is related to leaf area index. Clumping index theoretically declines with increasing woody cover until the tree canopy begins to become uniform. In this study, clumping index is calculated for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BRDF data for the Australian tropical savanna, the tropical savannas of South America, and the tropical savannas of east, west and southern Africa and compared with site-based measurements of tree canopy cover, and with area-based classifications of land cover. There were differences in sensitivity of clumping index between red and near-infrared reflectance channels, and between savanna systems with markedly different woody vegetation physiognomy. Clumping index was broadly related to foliage cover from historical site data in Australia and in West Africa and Kenya, but not in Southern Africa nor with detailed site-based demographic data in the cerrado of Brazil. However, clumping index decreased with proportion of woody cover in land cover datasets for east Africa, Australia and the Colombian Llanos. There was overlap in the range of clumping index values for forest, cerrado and campo land covers in Brazil. Clumping index was generally negatively correlated with percentage tree cover from the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product, but regional differences in the relationship were evident. There were large differences in the frequency distributions of clumping index from savanna, woody savanna and grassland land cover classes between global ecoregions. The clumping index shows differing sensitivity to savanna woody cover for red and NIR reflectance, and requires regional calibration for application as a universal indicator.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric response patterns associated with tropical forcing are examined with general circulation models driven by global sea surface temperature (SST) variations during 1950â€“99. Specifically the sensitivity of mid- latitude responses to the magnitude and position of tropical SST anomalies is explored. This controversial problem, spanning more than a quarter century now, centers on whether response patterns over the Pacificâ€“ North American region are affected or changed by interâ€“El Nin Ëœo variability in tropical forcing. Ensemble methods are used in this study to reliably identify the signals related to various tropical SST forcings, and the sensitivity is determined from analysis of four different climate models. First, the fraction of Pacificâ€“North American (PNA) wintertime 500-hPa height variability that is potentially predictable and is linked to interannual variations in the global SSTs is identified. This SST-forced component accounts for as much as 20\%â€“30\% of the total seasonal mean height variability over portions of the PNA region, and the most important boundary forcing originates from the tropical Pacific Ocean. The spatial expression of the teleconnections that are linked to this potentially predictable SST-forced fraction of height variability is next identified. The leading model pattern is similar to the classic observed teleconnection associated with the linear ENSO signal, and explains 80\% of the SST-forced height variance over parts of the North Pacific and North America. Two additional wavelike patterns are identified that are also associated with tropical forcing. One is related to the pattern of tropical SST variations often seen during the transition of the tropical ocean that marks the interlude between ENSO extremes, and the pattern of forcing related to it is distinctly non-ENSO in character. The other is related to the nonlinear component of the atmospheric response to ENSOâ€™s extreme opposite phases. Response patterns having annular-like structures over the Northern Hemisphere that are related to multidecadal variations in tropical Indo-Pacific and Atlantic SSTs are also highlighted. Subtle modifications in upper-level responses to different tropical SST forcings are shown to yield dispro- portionate sensitivity in North American surface climate. Particularly pronounced is the reversal in sign of the precipitation anomalies over the region spanning the Canadian border to southern California in response to equatorial Pacific convection anomalies shifting from 170î€¸E to 140î€¸W. The behavior is reproduced in experiments using both realistic and idealized SST anomalies, and this behavior is found to emerge particularly when the far eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is strongly warmed as occurred during the 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Nin Ëœos. Despite the existence of different response patterns to tropical SST forcings, it is shown that the seasonal hindcast skill of PNA 500-hPa heights for 1950â€“99 originates mainly from the single, leading teleconnection structure. The conclusion drawn from this result is that the atmospheric sensitivity to different tropical SST forcings, though real, is weak and easily masked by the year-to-year climate variations due to internal atmospheric processes. 1.

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of the climatic record at forest plot locations may be useful in studying how forests will respond to future climatic change. Kriging was applied to the spatial interpolation of monthly temperature records in the forested regions of Minnesota in the north central United States. Monthly empirical variograms, averaged over 90 yr, were modeled with Gaussian or linear models, and ordinary kriging was applied to interpolate the data. Anisotropies were found in the winter months, suggesting the presence of a large-scale regional trend. Structural analysis of mean monthly temperature revealed: (1) a broad regional component to the variation, changing systematically by month, which was estimated by a linear function of latitude and longitude and (2) a lake effect (due to Lake Superior) varying in strength and sign by month. A detrending approach was tested to remove these effects and a modified approach based on only the lake effect trend was also tested. The cross validation technique was used to test the 3 models. The lake effect trend model was judged best in accounting for the influence of Lake Superior on nearby land areas. The study demonstrated that moderate trends in the data do not seriously degrade the applicability of ordinary kriging to the interpolation of monthly temperature. A temporal analysis revealed that, although there have been systematic changes in the spatial variability over the last century, using century-averaged variograms is not expected to decrease the accuracy and precision of the interpolations.},

ENSO-induced pulses of enhanced plant productivity can cascade upward through the food web invoking unforeseen feedbacks, and can cause open dryland ecosystems to shift to permanent woodlands. These insights suggest that the predicted change in extreme climatic events resulting from global warming could profoundly alter biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in many regions of the world. Our increasing ability to predict El Ni\~{n}o effects can be used to enhance management strategies for the restoration of degraded ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: In a biogeographical context, the term Macaronesia broadly embraces the North Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde. The peculiar arid climatic conditions in some of these places have led to the development of marine salt exploitations, which can be counted among the hypersaline habitats of the brine shrimp Artemia (Branchiopoda, Anostraca). Parthenogenetic populations of this anostracan were described in the Canary Islands during the last decades of the 20th century, while the American Artemia franciscana species was recently found in the Cape Verde archipelago. Following an invasive pattern, this exotic species has recently reached the Canary Islands, too. This paper reports information dealing with biotope loss (solar saltworks) in this biogeographical region, together with possible consequences concerning the arrival of invasive species, two factors that frequently promote dramatic biodiversity losses. The discussion of this threat focuses mainly on the Canary Islands archipelago where native species of Artemia still exist.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems. Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40\%) reduced plant production by 5-10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {{A 1961-1990 mean monthly climatology for a `greater European' region extending from 32 degrees W to 66 degrees E and from 25 degrees to 81 degrees N has been constructed at a resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude for a suite of nine surface climate variables: minimum, maximum, and mean air temperature; precipitation totals; sunshine hours; vapour pressure; wind speed; and (ground) frost day and rain day (>0.1 mm) frequencies. This climatology has been constructed from observed station data distributed across the region. Station frequencies range from 936 (wind speed) to 3078 (precipitation). Over 95 per cent of these data are based on observations between 1961 and 1990 and over 90 per cent were supplied by individual national meteorological agencies (NMAs) on specific request. For four variables, some standardization of the data had to be performed because different countries supplied data under different definitions. Thus cloud cover had to be converted to sunshine hours, relative humidity to vapour pressure, air frost days to ground frost days and rain days > 1 mm to rain days >0.1 mm. The interpolation of the station data to the grid used elevation as one of the predictor variables and thus enabled three climate surfaces to be produced for each variable, reflecting the minimum, mean, and maximum elevation within each 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees cell. Subsets of stations were used for the interpolation of each variable, the selection being based on optimizing the spatial distribution, source priority and length of record. The accuracy of the various interpolations was assessed using validation sets of independent station data (i.e. those not used in the interpolation). Estimated mean absolute errors (MAE) ranged from under 4 per cent for vapour pressure to about 10 per cent for precipitation and up to 20 per cent for wind speed. The accuracy of the interpolated surfaces for minimum and maximum temperature was between 0.5 degrees C and 0.8 degrees C. We believe these results constitute the first climatology that has been constructed for this extensive European region at such a fine spatial resolution (0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees) from relatively dense station networks, for three different elevation surfaces and for a wide range of surface climate variables, all expressed with respect to a standard 30-year period. The climatology is already being used by researchers for applications in the areas of ecosystem modelling, climate change impact assessment and climate model validation, and is available from the authors.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Thin plate smoothing splines provide accurate, operationally straight-forward and computationally efficient solutions to the problem of the spatial interpolation of annual mean rainfall for a standard period from point data which contains many short period rainfall means. The analyses depend on developing a statistical model of the spatial variation of the observed rainfall means, considered as noisy estimates of standard period means. The error structure of this model has two components which allow separately for strong spatially correlated departures of observed short term means from standard period means and for uncorrelated deficiencies in the representation of standard period mean rainfall by a smooth function of position and elevation. Thin plate splines, with the degree of smoothing determining by minimising generalised cross validation, can estimate this smooth function in two ways. First, the spatially correlated error structure of the data can be accommodated directly by estimating the corresponding non-diagonal error covariance matrix. Secondly, spatial correlation in the data error structure can be removed by standardising the observed short term means to standard period mean estimates using linear regression. When applied to data both methods give similar interpolation accuracy, and error estimates of the fitted surfaces are in good agreement with residuals from withheld data. Simplified versions of the data error model, which require only minimal summary data at each location, are also presented. The interpolation accuracy obtained with these models is only slightly inferior to that obtained with more complete statistical models. It is shown that the incorporation of a continuous, spatially varying, dependence on appropriately scaled elevation makes a dominant contribution to surface accuracy. Incorporating dependence on aspect, as determined from a digital elevation model, makes only a marginal further improvement.}},

  Abstract                 = {The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is currently used to evaporate water. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on landâˆ’a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variabilityâˆ’remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1â€‰Â±â€‰1.0â€‰millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni\~{n}o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.},

The confounding of the first category by the latter has introduced confusion in the scientific literature on altitude phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {Surface observations and subsurface ocean assimilation datasets are examined to contrast two distinct types of El NinËœoâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific: an eastern-Pacific (EP) type and a central-Pacific (CP) type. An analysis method combining empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and linear regression is used to separate these two types. Correlation and composite analyses based on the principal components of the EOF were performed to examine the structure, evolution, and teleconnection of these two ENSO types. The EP type of ENSO is found to have its SST anomaly center located in the eastern equatorial Pacific attached to the coast of South America. This type of ENSO is associated with basinwide thermocline and surface wind variations and shows a strong teleconnection with the tropical Indian Ocean. In contrast, the CP type of ENSO has most of its surface wind, SST, and subsurface anomalies confined in the central Pacific and tends to onset, develop, and decay in situ. This type of ENSO appears less related to the thermocline variations and may be influenced more by atmospheric forcing. It has a stronger teleconnection with the southern Indian Ocean. Phase-reversal signatures can be identified in the anomaly evolutions of the EP-ENSO but not for the CP-ENSO. This implies that the CP-ENSO may occur more as events or epochs than as a cycle. The EP-ENSO has experienced a stronger interdecadal change with the dominant period of its SST anomalies shifted from 2 to 4 yr near 1976/77, while the dominant period for the CP-ENSO stayed near the 2-yr band. The different onset times of these two types of ENSO imply that the difference between the EP and CP types of ENSO could be caused by the timing of the mechanisms that trigger the ENSO events.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate simulations for East Africa have been performed with the regional climate model CLM. Here we evaluate the quality of simulated precipitation by comparing it with observations. Different schemes for convection and cloud ice have been tested in order to determine the configuration with best representation of precipitation patterns for the region. The simulated seasonal behaviour of precipitation is reasonable in all configurations, whereas absolute values are strongly influenced by the selected schemes. Best agreement with observations is achieved with the Tiedtke mass-flux convection scheme in combination with a two- category cloud ice scheme, that considers cloud ice as an additional solid formofwater.With theKain-Fritsch convection scheme the model generally overestimates precipitation. Regional differences are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Current unprecedented declines in biodiversity reduce the ability of ecological communities to provide many fundamental ecosystem services. Here we evaluate evidence that reduced biodiversity affects the transmission of infectious diseases of humans, other animals and plants. In principle, loss of biodiversity could either increase or decrease disease transmission. However, mounting evidence indicates that biodiversity loss frequently increases disease transmission. In contrast, areas of naturally high biodiversity may serve as a source pool for new pathogens. Overall, despite many remaining questions, current evidence indicates that preserving intact ecosystems and their endemic biodiversity should generally reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Managing ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a potential 'win-win' scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We measured above- and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha(-1) to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha(-1) showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60\% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels.},

  Abstract                 = {{Extreme weather and climate events have major negative effects on Tanzania's economy. Recently, the prolonged drought from 1998 to 2005 caused devastating crop failures, livestock losses and reductions in the country's water reservoir levels, which, in turn, created food shortages and rationing of hydroelectric power and water. The present study analyses the atmospheric circulations associated with the 1998 to 2005 drought that affected the northeastern highlands of Tanzania. Analysis of large-scale circulation indicates that the drought during the October to December (OND) short rainy seasons, from 1998 to 2005, was related to westerly low-level moisture flux divergence and subsidence over northern Tanzania associated with an eastward shift of the Walker cell. For the March to May (MAM) long rainy seasons, the prolonged drought was related to strong moisture flux divergence over the region and subsidence associated with the occurrence of the descending branch of a Walker-type circulation over the region. Rainfall onset was undefined for most years in both the OND and the MAM seasons, and, in all cases, unevenly distributed rains with prolonged dry spells were experienced in a shorter than average rainy season. However, an out-of-season rainfall peak occurred in January, after the end of the OND rains. This delayed peak has important implications for agricultural and water resource activities. The circulation patterns observed in the Tanzanian region from 1998 to 2005 were similar to those experienced during a previous prolonged drought (1973 to 1976), suggesting that some predictability of drought may exist.}},

It is assumed that the zenith angle of the viewing direction is equal to zero (thus corresponding to the case of nadir observations), whereas the light incidence direction is arbitrary. The formula yields accurate results for incidence-zenith angles less than approximately 85 degrees and can be useful in analyzing satellite nadir observations of optically thick clouds.},

The formulas obtained are based on the approximate analytical solutions of the radiative transfer equation for optically thick, weakly absorbing layers and the geometrical optics approximation for local optical characteristics of cloud media. The accuracy of the approximate formulas was studied with an exact radiative transfer code. The relative error of the approximate formula for the reflection function at nadir observations was less then 15\% for an optical thickness larger than 10 and a single-scattering albedo larger than 0.95.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, two types of El NinËœo events are classified based on spatial patterns of the sea surface tem- perature (SST) anomaly. One is the cold tongue (CT) El NinËœo, which can be regarded as the conventional El NinËœo, and the other the warm pool (WP) El NinËœo. The CT El NinËœo is characterized by relatively large SST anomalies in the NinËœo-3 region (58Sâ€“58N, 1508â€“908W), while theWP El NinËœo is associated with SST anomalies mostly confined to the NinËœo-4 region (58Sâ€“58N, 1608Eâ€“1508W). In addition, spatial patterns of many atmo- spheric and oceanic variables are also distinctively different for the two types of El NinËœo events. Furthermore, the difference in the transition mechanism between the two types of El NinËœo is clearly identified. That is, the discharge process of the equatorial heat content associated with theWP El NinËœo is not efficient owing to the spatial structure of SST anomaly; as a result, it cannot trigger a cold event. It is also demonstrated that zonal advective feedback (i.e., zonal advection ofmean SST by anomalous zonal currents) plays a crucial role in the development of a decaying SST anomaly associated with theWP El NinËœo, while thermocline feedback is a key process during the CT El NinËœo.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of the 140-year historical record suggests that the inverse relationship between the El Nin Ëœoâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer monsoon (weak monsoon arising from warm ENSO event) has broken down in recent decades. Two possible reasons emerge from the analyses. A southeast- ward shift in the Walker circulation anomalies associated with ENSO events may lead to a reduced subsidence over the Indian region, thus favoring normal monsoon conditions. Additionally, increased surface temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring, which are a part of the midlatitude continental warming trend, may favor the enhanced land-ocean thermal gradient conducive to a strong monsoon. These observations raise the possibility that the Eurasian warming in recent decades helps to sustain the monsoon rainfall at a normal level despite strong ENSO events.},

  Abstract                 = {Amphibians are globally declining and approximately one-third of all species are threatened with extinction. Some of the most severe declines have occurred suddenly and for unknown reasons in apparently pristine habitats. It has been hypothesized that these "rapid enigmatic declines" are the result of a panzootic of the disease chytridiomycosis caused by globally emerging amphibian chytrid fungus. In a Species Distribution Model, we identified the potential distribution of this pathogen. Areas and species from which rapid enigmatic decline are known significantly overlap with those of highest environmental suitability to the chytrid fungus. We confirm the plausibility of a link between rapid enigmatic decline in worldwide amphibian species and epizootic chytridiomycosis.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to better manage the limited water resources in arid regions, accurate determination of plant water requirements is necessary. For that, the evaluation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0)-a basic component of the hydrological cycle-is essential. In this context, the Penman Monteith equation, known for its accuracy, requires a high number of climatic parameters that are not always fully available from most meteorological stations. Our study examines the effectiveness of the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the evaluation of ET0 using incomplete meteorological parameters. These neural networks use daily climatic data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and the insolation duration) as inputs, and ET0 values estimated by the Penman-Monteith formula as outputs. The results show that the proper choice of neural network architecture allows not only error minimization but also maximizes the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In fact, with a network of two hidden layers and eight neurons per layer, we obtained, during the test phase, values of 1, 1 and 0.01 for the determination coefficient, the criterion of Nash and the mean square error, respectively. Comparing results between multiple linear regression and the neural method revealed the good modeling quality and high performance of the latter, due to the possibility of improving performance criteria. In this work, we considered correlations between input variables that improve the accuracy of the model and do not pose problems of multi-collinearity. Furthermore, we succeeded in avoiding overfitting and could generalize the model for other similar areas.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the consequences of the new NOAA definition of El Nin autumns and winters as El Nin Ëœo is the identification of a number of boreal Ëœo seasons that are not conventionally so identified. In these periods SST anomalies are concentrated significantly more toward the International Dateline than usual.We show here that the seasonal weather anomalies typically associated with these additional â€˜â€˜Dateline El Nin over much of the world, and suggest that it is useful to treat these as different types of â€˜â€˜El Nin Ëœoâ€™â€™ seasons are different in useful respects Ëœoâ€™â€™ for purposes of seasonal weather forecasting.

  Abstract                 = {Effects of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) on the circulation and thermal structure of the Pacific and Indian Oceans are studied by comparing solutions of a near-global ocean general circulation model with open and closed Indonesian passages from 1981 to 1997. The ITF contributes to the maintenance of the model circulation system around eastern Australia and the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF weakens the Indian Ocean South Equatorial Current and Agulhas Current and strengthens the East Australian Current. The ITF does not affect the Mindanao Current, but drains waters carried by this current into the Indian Ocean and thus reduces tropicalâ€“subtropical exchange in the North Pacific. Meanwhile, it helps maintain a stronger New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent and thus enhances tropicalâ€“ subtropical exchange in the south. Water parcels traveling along the western boundary of the South Pacific cross the equator in the presence of the ITF but are confined to the Southern Hemisphere without the ITF. The southern â€˜â€˜exchange windowâ€™â€™ in which subducted waters can reach the Tropics is wider with than without the ITF. Some parcels from the southern subtropics can reach the Tropics with open ITF, but recirculate back to the subtropical gyre when the ITF is closed. These â€˜â€˜excessâ€™â€™ recirculated parcels reach several degrees farther south and outcrop north of Tasmania. The consequence on sea surface temperature (SST) there may have an important implication to the local climate. Blockage of the ITF depresses the mean thermocline of the tropical Pacific, increases SST in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific, and thus reduces the SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue. It also raises the mean thermocline of the Indian Ocean (especially the southern Indian Ocean) and decreases SST in the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF reduces seasonal-to-interannual thermocline fluctuations in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific because the resulting deeper thermocline attenuates fluctuations in response to local Ekman pumping. The opposite is true in the southern Indian Ocean for the interannual timescale. However, seasonal thermocline fluctuation in that area is weakened when the ITF is blocked (despite a shallower thermocline). It indicates that local Ekman pumping is not the dominant mechanism controlling seasonal thermocline variability there as previously suggested. Radiation of planetary waves from the ITF area and advection by the ITF-dependent South Equatorial Current could also be important. Blockage of the ITF also reduces interannual variability of SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific and enhances those in the tropical southern Indian Ocean and south of Tasmania. The results indicate that the ITF may affect El Nin exchanges, mean tropical thermocline structure, mean SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue, and seasonal-to-interannual variabilities of thermocline depth and SST.

  Abstract                 = {Photosynthetic parameters were investigated in relation to light intensity (PAR and UV-B) in two Chilean Prosopis sp., Prosopis chilensis and Prosopis tamarugo in their natural habitats. The objective of this work was to compare the photosynthetic responses and to determine the degree of adaptation of both species to visible- and UV-radiation stress. One of the study sites was Refresco in the Atacama Desert, where P. tamarugo is an endemic plant and P. chilensis was introduced, and the other was Peldehue in the valley of Central Chile where only P. chilensis is present. Due to latitude, light intensity (UV-B and PAR) is higher in Refresco than in Peldehue. The parameters investigated in both species were photosystem II fluorescence, CO(2) assimilation, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigment composition, flavonoid absorption patterns and composition of chlorophyll-protein complexes. Fluorescence studies, CO(2) assimilation and stomatal conductance studies demonstrated that photosynthetic activity is more efficient and stable throughout the day in P. tamarugo than in P. chilensis in Refresco. Chlorophyll-protein complexes also seemed to be more stable in P. tamarugo than in P. chilensis. Photosynthetic pigment analyses indicated possible photodamage in P. chilensis trees in Refresco, but not in Peldehue. Such photodamage was absent in P. tamarugo. There was a considerable change in the flavonoid pattern between noon and afternoon hours in both species at both study sites. The physiological implications of these changes indicate that P. tamarugo is more adapted to high solar radiation than P. chilensis.},

  Abstract                 = {{1. The prediction and mapping of climate in areas between climate stations is of increasing importance in ecology. 2. Four categories of model, simple interpolation, thin plate splines, multiple linear regression and mixed spline-regression, were tested for their ability to predict the spatial distribution of temperature on the British mainland. The models were tested by external cross-verification. 3. The British distribution of mean daily temperature was predicted with the greatest accuracy by using a mixed model: a thin plate spline fitted to the surface of the country, after correction of the data by a selection from 16 independent topographical variables (such as altitude, distance from the sea, slope and topographic roughness), chosen by multiple regression from a digital terrain model (DTM) of the country. 4. The next most accurate method was a pure multiple regression model using the DTM. Both regression and thin plate spline models based on a few variables (latitude, longitude and altitude) only were comparatively unsatisfactory, but some rather simple methods of surface interpolation (such as bilinear interpolation after correction to sea level) gave moderately satisfactory results. Differences between the methods seemed to be dependent largely on their ability to model the effect of the sea on land temperatures. 5. Prediction of temperature by the best methods was greater than 95\% accurate in all months of the year, as shown by the correlation between the predicted and actual values. The predicted temperatures were calculated at real altitudes, not subject to sea-level correction. 6. A minimum of just over 30 temperature recording stations would generate a satisfactory surface, provided the stations were well spaced. 7. Maps of mean daily temperature, using the best overall methods are provided; further important variables, such as continentality and length of growing season, were also mapped. Many of these are believed to be the first detailed representations at real altitude. 8. The interpolated monthly temperature surfaces are available on disk.}},

  Abstract                 = {A long-term genetic legacy of refugial isolation has been postulated and was demonstrated for maternal refugial lineages for numerous plant and animal species. The lineages were assumed to have remained separated from each other for several glacial periods. The conifer Abies alba Miller, silver fir, is an excellent model to test whether pollen-mediated gene flow may eliminate the genetic imprints of Pleistocene refugial isolation. Two DNA markers with contrasting modes of inheritance were applied to 100 populations covering the entire range of silver fir in Europe. The markers exhibited each two highly conserved alleles based on an insertion/deletion of 80 bp in the fourth intron of the mitochondrial nad5 gene and on a synonymous substitution in the chloroplast psbC gene. The geographical distribution of the maternally inherited mitochondrial variation supported the existence of at least two refugia with two recolonizing maternal lineages remaining largely separated throughout the range. The cline of the nad5 allele frequencies was much steeper than the one of the two psbC alleles. The psbC cline was as wide as the whole range of the species. Our results provide striking evidence that even a species with very long generation times and heavy pollen grains was able to establish a highly efficient pollen-mediated gene flow between refugia. Therefore we postulate that an exchange of genetic information between refugia by range-wide paternal introgression is possible in wind-pollinated plant species.},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper investigates the effects of cloud microphysics parameterizations on simulations of warmseason precipitation at convection- permitting grid spacing. The objective is to assess the sensitivity of summertime convection predictions to the bulk microphysics parameterizations ( BMPs) at fine- grid spacings applicable to the next generation of operational numerical weather prediction models. Four microphysical parameterization schemes are compared: simple ice ( Dudhia), four- class mixed phase ( Reisner et al.), Goddard five- class mixed phase ( Tao and Simpson), and five- class mixed phase with graupel ( Reisner et al.). The experimentation involves a 7- day episode ( 3 - 9 July 2003) of U. S. midsummer convection under moderate large- scale forcing. Overall, the precipitation coherency manifested as eastwardmoving organized convection in the lee of the Rockies is insensitive to the choice of the microphysics schemes, and the latent heating profiles are also largely comparable among the BMPs. The upper- level condensate and cloudiness, upper- level radiative cooling/ heating, and rainfall spectrum are the most sensitive, whereas the domain- mean rainfall rate and areal coverage display moderate sensitivity. Overall, the three mixed- phase schemes outperform the simple ice scheme, but a general conclusion about the degree of sophistication in the microphysics treatment and the performance is not achievable.}},

  Abstract                 = {The mass balance of a glacier represents the most direct (but, basically, local) link between glacier behavior and climate forcing. To learn more about glacier-climate in- teractions on Kilimanjaro, we maintain automatic weather stations in the glacierized summit area between 5700 and 5900 m above sea level. This provides us with a rare opportunity to derive climate change in the mid-troposphere, a region with a lack of climate data. All results so far (based on meteorological measurements and mass bal- ance modeling) underline the importance of solid precipitation for these glaciers. In agreement with lowland proxy data, the retreating glaciers therefore most probably indicate a shift from relatively wet to relatively dry conditions. However, Kiliman- jaro is the highest free-standing mountain in the world, so its summit area is a unique sample point in the free atmosphere. Hence, we are also in the position to explore the potential of glacier response to climate change at scales beyond local or regional. The large-scale climate link is investigated by experiments with a coupled atmosphere- ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). These experiments show a drastic change in moisture supply from the Indian Ocean into East Africa between the 19th and 20th century, which provides the framework for changed precipitation conditions over the glaciers. The large-scale flow, however, is known to be strongly modified by high mountains such as Kilimanjaro. Mesoscale experiments with a numerical atmospheric model therefore complement our study. Results reveal that â€“ as the moisture structure and stability of approaching air masses change â€“ precipitation does not change uni- formly with altitude but the shape of the vertical profile of precipitation on the slopes of Kilimanjaro is altered. The impacts of this finding on the glaciers are discussed. In summary, this study demonstrates how the use of atmospheric- and climate-science methods may add value to local-scale mass balance studies, and that tropical climate change at high altitude is enhanced compared to lower elevations.},

  Abstract                 = {The mass balance of a glacier represents the most direct (but, basically, local) link between glacier behavior and climate forcing. To learn more about glacier-climate in- teractions on Kilimanjaro, we maintain automatic weather stations in the glacierized summit area between 5700 and 5900 m above sea level. This provides us with a rare opportunity to derive climate change in the mid-troposphere, a region with a lack of climate data. All results so far (based on meteorological measurements and mass bal- ance modeling) underline the importance of solid precipitation for these glaciers. In agreement with lowland proxy data, the retreating glaciers therefore most probably indicate a shift from relatively wet to relatively dry conditions. However, Kiliman- jaro is the highest free-standing mountain in the world, so its summit area is a unique sample point in the free atmosphere. Hence, we are also in the position to explore the potential of glacier response to climate change at scales beyond local or regional. The large-scale climate link is investigated by experiments with a coupled atmosphere- ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). These experiments show a drastic change in moisture supply from the Indian Ocean into East Africa between the 19th and 20th century, which provides the framework for changed precipitation conditions over the glaciers. The large-scale flow, however, is known to be strongly modified by high mountains such as Kilimanjaro. Mesoscale experiments with a numerical atmospheric model therefore complement our study. Results reveal that â€“ as the moisture structure and stability of approaching air masses change â€“ precipitation does not change uni- formly with altitude but the shape of the vertical profile of precipitation on the slopes of Kilimanjaro is altered. The impacts of this finding on the glaciers are discussed. In summary, this study demonstrates how the use of atmospheric- and climate-science methods may add value to local-scale mass balance studies, and that tropical climate change at high altitude is enhanced compared to lower elevations.},

Multiyear meteorological measurements at 5873mMSLserve to force and verify a spatially distributed model of the glacierâ€™s mass balance (the most direct link between glacier behavior and atmospheric forcing). At present the glacier is losing mass (5226105 kgm22 yr21), terminates at 5100 m, and the interannual variability of mass and energy budgets largely reflects variability in atmospheric moisture. Backward modeling of the L19 steady-state glacier extent (down to 4500 m) reveals higher precipitation (1160 to 1240mm yr21), higher air humidity, and increased fractional cloud cover in L19 but no significant changes in local air temperature, air pressure, and wind speed. The atmosphere in the simulated L19 climate transfers more energy to the glacier surface through atmospheric longwave radiation and turbulent heatâ€”but this is almost entirely balanced by the decrease in absorbed solar radiation (due to both increased cloudiness and higher surface albedo). Thus, the energy-driven mass loss per unit area (sublimation plus meltwater runoff) was not appreciably different from today. Higher L19 precipitation rates therefore dominated the mass budget and produced a larger glacier extent in the past},

  Abstract                 = {Here, palaeobotanical and genetic data for common beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Europe are used to evaluate the genetic consequences of long-term survival in refuge areas and postglacial spread. Four large datasets are presented, including over 400 fossil-pollen sites, 80 plant-macrofossil sites, and 450 and 600 modern beech populations for chloroplast and nuclear markers, respectively. The largely complementary palaeobotanical and genetic data indicate that: (i) beech survived the last glacial period in multiple refuge areas; (ii) the central European refugia were separated from the Mediterranean refugia; (iii) the Mediterranean refuges did not contribute to the colonization of central and northern Europe; (iv) some populations expanded considerably during the postglacial period, while others experienced only a limited expansion; (v) the mountain chains were not geographical barriers for beech but rather facilitated its diffusion; and (vi) the modern genetic diversity was shaped over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. This scenario differs from many recent treatments of tree phylogeography in Europe that largely focus on the last ice age and the postglacial period to interpret genetic structure and argue that the southern peninsulas (Iberian, Italian and Balkan) were the main source areas for trees in central and northern Europe.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use changes in East Africa have transformed land cover to farmlands, grazing lands, human settlements and urban centers at the expense of natural vegetation. These changes are associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss and land degradation. A synthesis of results of long term research by an interdisciplinary team reveals the linkages between land use change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. The results indicate that as native vegetation is lost, indigenous plant and animal biodiversity and plant cover are lost. Pastoralism maintains native plant and animal species more effectively than crop cultivation. As croplands expand, soil fertility and moisture drops and soils erode more easily. Farmers who grow many crops conserve native plant species better than those who grow only one crop. Increased crop diversity encourages regeneration of indigenous plant species. Moderate farming as in the less intensive low input rainfed mixed crop farming, in less forested areas increases tree cover thus increasing the biodiversity. Farmersâ€™ who combine livestock rearing with cropping, use livestock manure to replenish soil nutrients in their farms and are thus able to maintain higher productivity. Farming in grasslands, woodlands and bushland areas where there are fewer trees, increases the diversity of habitats due to introduction of agrosystems that attract new species of birds. However, if the farming is intensified and the diversity of habitats is reduced biodiversity is also reduced. This paper presents findings of the investigations on these linkages in a diverse farming and herding systems ranging from lowlands to high mountains land uses.},

  Abstract                 = {Plants that use fog as an important water-source frequently have a rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the "narrow-leaf syndrome" should increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can only have a few blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave as a result of their dependence on fog.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in glacier extent are effects of the variability of the atmospheric conditions integrated over a time span similar to that often referred to as the timescale on which the climate system should be assessed (i. e., decades). In remote locations characterized through sparse instrumental data records, such as Kilimanjaro, glaciers therefore provide a valuable opportunity to reveal climate change. However, in order to be able to make statements about the large scale, potential local influences have to be understood. In the case of Kilimajaro, large changes in vegetation have been observed, in particular resulting in re- duced montane and subalpine forest coverage. Using a numerical atmospheric circulation model (WRF), we quantify the impact of anthropogenic land-use change around Kilimanjaro on summit climate, using on-site automated weather stations as validation tools.We then use a glacier mass balance model to directly evaluate the impact of local scale vegetation change on the glaciers of Kilimanjaro.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim The FAO land-cover classification system (LCCS) represents an innovative approach to standardizing and harmonizing land-cover classifications based on remote sensing data. The thematic information considered by the LCCS, however, is intrinsically related to vegetation physiognomy and does not report important eco-climatic features. Our aim is to develop a methodology to enrich LCCS maps with information on vegetation productivity and phenology derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Location The LCCS has recently been applied in East Africa by the Africover project. The proposed methodology is developed and tested in Tanzania using MODIS NDVI data for a 5-year period (2001â€“05). Methods Annual NDVI profiles of Africover polygons were extracted from MODIS imagery. These profiles, composed of 23 NDVI values per year, were averaged over the study period, purified for possible land-cover errors and converted into a more manageable format composed of 24 half-month values. The resulting NDVI profiles were first analysed visually and then evaluated statistically against rainfall measurements taken at 12 Tanzanian stations. The steps involved were as follows: NDVI values were aggregated on a monthly basis and represented with a one-digit integer to obtain an extended code; a subset of parameters describing vegetation development and phenology was identified, thus obtaining a restricted codification; and finally, the information loss resulting from both the extended and restricted codification was evaluated with respect to the original NDVI profiles. Results NDVI profiles of different Africover classes can differ in mean values but tend to have a similar shape, linked to the seasonality of local vegetation. Both NDVI annual averages and seasonal variations are strictly dependent on rainfall patterns, particularly in arid zones. The tested codifications effectively summarize the eco-climatic information contained in the polygon NDVI profiles, with the extended and restricted codifications retaining > 90\% and 80\% of such information, respectively. Main conclusions The proposed methodology is capable of enriching LCCS polygons with eco-climatic information derived from MODIS NDVI data. Such information is related to vegetation development and seasonality, and can be efficiently condensed at various levels of detail.},

  Abstract                 = {Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, the highest mountain in Africa, has undergone extensive hydrologic changes over the past century in an area where water resources are critical. A hydrochemical and isotopic synoptic sampling program in January 2006 is used to characterize hydro- geology, hydrology, and water quality of the area. Samples were collected from the summit and southern side of Kilimanjaro and the Moshi region (Tanzania). Sample sources included four glaciers, seven groundwater wells, 12 rivers, 10 springs, precipitation, and a lake. Analyses included major ion chemistry, stable isotopes of water (18O and D); in addition, seven samples were analyzed for tritium. The samples generally have good water quality with the exception of three samples with elevated fluoride concentrations (>3 mg/L) and elevated nitrate concen- trations (>2.5 mg/L NO3 as N). There is a strong elevation control on stable isotopes, with an apparent elevation effect of â€“ 0.1 â€° $\delta$18O per 100 m rise in elevation (R2 = 0.79). The results, including the tritium values, show that the hydrogeologic system is comprised of both local and regional flow systems, and that regional rivers are receiving significant inflow from shallow groundwater, and at very high elevations the hydrologic system is derived from groundwater, precipitation, and glacial melt water.},

Studies such as those of Levizzani and Setv\'{a}k (1996) have indicated the existence of unexpected features on top of deep convection that could only be detected using satellite sensors: plumes of small ice crystals, rotational features and wave patterns. Several of these features are yet to be explained in their overall complexity since cloud dynamics and microphysics are involved at the same time. Deep convection is also being reconsidered as a very powerful engine for troposphere-to-stratosphere water vapor exchanges. Simulations of the optical properties of randomly oriented ice crystal particles on top of deep convective clouds are presented. Computations are based on a combined Mie and Huygens theory assuming columnar shapes of hexagonal section. Several ice crystal size ranges in the 2 to 20 Âµm interval were considered thereby producing different values of single scattering albedo, asymmetry factor and extinction coefficient. Real ice crystal size distributions at convective cloud top are simulated. Radiances at the top of deep convective storms are calculated for the following channels of the MSG SEVIRI: 0.8, 1.6, 3.9, 10.8 and 12 Âµm. Midlatitude cirrus anvils over deep convection are simulated to determine the SEVIRI channel sensitivity to changes in their radiative properties using the model STREAMER. Sensitivity is derived performing several tests varying the ice crystal size and the optical depth. Results are to be considered as a first tool to explore cloud top properties in conditions where in situ measurements are very much critical and very scarce data are available in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the findings of a study that analyzed land use and cover change, their driving forces and the socio-economic implications on the southern and eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. This study is based on data extracted from remote sensing techniques using 1973, 1984 and 1999/2000 satellite images and household interviews. The major change detected in the study area from satellite images was expansion of cultivation at the expense of natural vegetation. The area under cultivation increased from 54\% in 1973 to 62 and 63\% in 1984 and 2000, respectively. Expansion and intensification of cultivation were noted particularly in the lowlands while some forest areas in the highlands had become degraded. These changes led to changes in cropping patterns and crop diversification, declined productivity of land and food insecurity. The underlying drivers of these changes were demographic, government policies, economic factors, socio-cultural factors including the land tenure system, institutional factors, technological change and infrastructure development. Investments in irrigation technology, introduction of new crop varieties and government interventions to support the poor are required to improve the productivity of land and reduce the vulnerability of the people to environmental perturbations, including drought.},

  Abstract                 = {Land cover and its associated biophysical parameters govern many landâ€“atmosphere interactions. Several previous studies have demonstrated the utility of incorporating satellite-derived observations of land cover into climate models to improve prediction accuracy. In the developing world where agriculture is a primary livelihood, a better understanding of seasonal variability in precipitation and near-surface temperature is critical to constructing more effective coping strategies for climate changes and food security. However, relatively few studies have been able to assess the impacts of improved surface parameterisation on these variables and their seasonality. Using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived products, we sought to address this shortcoming by adapting leaf area index (LAI) and vegetative fractional cover (FC) products, along with an improved representation of the land surface (i.e. land use land cover) into the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System in East Africa to evaluate the effect improved representations would have on simulated precipitation and land surface temperature (LST). In particular, we tested the hypothesis that improved phenological parameterisations could reduce error in precipitation and LST under dramatically different atmospheric conditions. The model was used to simulate dry/normal/wet rainfall years of 2000, 2001, and 2002 (respectively) in order to understand biases in this parameterisation under different boundary conditions. Our results show a dramatic improvement in LST simulation due to the use of the improved representations (spline functions) during most of the year, both spatially and temporally. Annual precipitation, which is dependent upon a much greater variety of surface and atmospheric characteristics, did not improve as much by adopting the spline representations of LAI and FC; the results were more equivocal. However, seasonal timing of precipitation improved in some areas, and this improvement has important consequences for integrated climateâ€“agriculture assessments.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological and societal disruptions by modern climate change are critically determined by the time frame over which climates shift beyond historical analogues. Here we present a new index of the year when the projected mean climate of a given location moves to a state continuously outside the bounds of historical variability under alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069 (Â±18â€‰years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions stabilization scenario and 2047 (Â±14â€‰years s.d.) under a 'business-as-usual' scenario. Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries, highlighting the vulnerability of global biodiversity and the limited governmental capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change. Our findings shed light on the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions if climates potentially harmful to biodiversity and society are to be prevented.},

  Abstract                 = {This study estimates the impact of rainfall variation on livelihood in Mt. Kilimanjaro using the Ricardian approach to capture farmersâ€™ adaptation strategies to cope with climate change risks. The data for the analysis were gathered from a random sample of over 200 households in 15 villages and precipitation from rainfall observation posts placed in each of the surveyed villages. The precipitation data provide information on the effect of moisture at critical months in the growing season. Due to prevalence of intercropping among local farmers, the present study develops a multivariate model that assumes endogeneity between crop yields. Doing so allows the study to capture adaptation strategies that smallholders use by diversifying farm portfolio. The results indicate that Mt. Kilimanjaro agriculture is vulnerable to precipitation variation. However, farm vulnerability is heterogeneous across space, crops and, months. Location varying inputs are responsible for substantial percentage of crop yield. The study found ambiguous evidence about the ability of irrigation usage to reduce crop vulnerability to precipitation variation, but suggests that proper cost benefit analysis ought to be done in order to measure the welfare value of irrigation. In terms of future food security, climate simulations reveal that by 2029, it will no longer be ideal to produce coffee in Mt. Kilimanjaro if precipitation annually decreases by a minimum rate of 2\%. While maize production will also suffer severe production reduction, banana production will decrease but not in an alarming rate by 2029.},

  Abstract                 = {An anomalous climatic event occurred in the Indian Ocean (IO) region during 1997â€“1998, which coincided with a severe drought in Indonesia and floods in parts of eastern Africa. Cool sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) were present in the eastern IO along and south of the equator. Beginning in July 1997, warm SSTAs appeared in the western IO, and they peaked in February 1998. An ocean general circulation model is employed to investigate the dynamic and thermodynamic processes that caused the SSTAs associated with this and other similar IO events. The eastern cooling resulted from unusually strong upwelling along the equator and Sumatra. The Sumatran upwelling was forced both locally by the stronger alongshore winds and remotely by equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves. By the end of 1997, weakening of the winds and the associated reduction in latent heat loss led to the elimination of the cold SST anomalies in the east. The western warming was initiated by weaker Southwest Monsoon winds and maintained by enhanced precipitation forcing, which resulted in a barrier layer structure. Analysis of the mixed layer temperature equation indicates that a downwelling Rossby wave contribution was crucial for sustaining the warming into February 1998. It is tempting to suppose that the 1997 event was related to the El Nin Ëœo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event that took place in the Pacific at the same time. Indeed, weaker IO events occur quite regularly in the control run that evolve similarly to the 1997 event, and they are often but not always related to ENSO. We speculate that these events represent a natural mode of oscillation in the IO, which is externally forced by ENSO but also excited by ocean-atmosphere interactions internal to the IO.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the efficacy of a scheme of multiscale assessment of biodiversity linking remote sensing on larger spatial scales with localized field sampling. A classification of ecological entities from biosphere to individual organisms in the form of a nested hierarchy is employed, such that entities at any level are differentiated in terms of their composition/configuration involving entities at the next lower level. We employ the following hierarchy: biosphere (10(14) m(2)), ecoregions (10(11)-10(12) m(2)), ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)), ecotopes (10(3)-10(6) m(2)), and individual organisms (10(-4)-10(2) m(2)). Focusing on a case study of West Coast-Western Ghats ecoregion (1.7 x 10(11) m(2)) from India, we demonstrate that remotely sensed data permit discrimination of 205 patches of 11 types of sufficiently distinctive ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)) through unsupervised classification by using distribution parameters of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, with a pixel size of 3.24 x 10(6) m(2). At the ecomosaic scale, Indian Remote Sensing LISS-2 satellite data with a pixel size of 10(3) m(2) permit discrimination of approximately 30 types of sufficiently distinctive ecotopes on the basis of supervised classification. Field investigations of angiosperm species distributions based on quadrats of 1-10(2) m(2) in one particular landscape of 27.5 x 10(6) m(2) show that the seven ecotope types distinguished in that locality are significantly different from each other in terms of plant species composition. This suggests that we can effectively link localized field investigations of biodiversity with remotely sensed information to permit extrapolations at progressively higher scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Asymptotic expressions for the reflected, transmitted, and internal scattered radiation field in optically thick, vertically homogeneous, plane-parallel media are derived from first principles by using the discrete ordinates method of radiative transfer. Compact matrix equations are derived for computing the escape function, diffusion pattern, diffusion exponent, and the reflection function of a semi-infinite atmosphere in terms of the matrices, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues that occur in the discrete ordinates method. These matrix equations are suitable for numerical computations and are valid throughout the full range of single scattering albedos. The present formulations are validated by comparing them with established methods of radiative transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial interpolation of climatic data is frequently required to provide input for plant growth models. As no single method is optimal for all regions, it is important to compare the results obtained using alternative methods applied to each data set. For estimating 30-year averages (Normals) of monthly temperature and precipitation at specific sites in western Canada, we examined four forms of kriging and three simple alternatives. One of the alternatives was a novel technique, termed `gradient-plus-inverse distance squared' (GIDS), which combines multiple linear regression and distance-weighting. Based on the mean absolute errors from cross-validation tests, the methods were ranked GIDS&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;detrended kriging&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;nearest neighbour&#xa0;&gt;co-kriging&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;inverse distance squared&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;universal kriging&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;ordinary kriging for interpolating monthly temperature, and GIDS&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;co-kriging&gt;inverse distance squared&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;nearest neighbour&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;ordinary kriging&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;detrended kriging&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;universal kriging for interpolating monthly precipitation. \{GIDS\} gave the lowest errors, which averaged 0.5Â°C for monthly temperature and 3.6&#xa0;mm, or 11%, for monthly precipitation. These errors were comparable with those from optimal methods in other studies. \{GIDS\} errors were also more consistent for a wide range of data variability than the other methods. The performance of kriging may have been constrained by the limited number of stations (32) in the study region, but if so, this is an unavoidable limitation in regions with sparse coverage of climate stations. Compared with kriging, \{GIDS\} was simple to apply and avoided the subjectivity involved in defining variogram models and neighbourhoods. We conclude that \{GIDS\} is a simple, robust and accurate interpolation method for use in our region, and that it should be applicable elsewhere, subject to careful comparison with other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A new technique relying on SimpLe Approximations for cLOudy Media (SLALOM) for the retrieval of cloud optical and microphysical parameters from optical satellite data during daytime is introduced. The technique is based on simple yet highly accurate approximations of the asymptotic solutions of the radiative transfer theory which have already been implemented in the forward radiative transfer model CLOUD. These approximations enable a solution of the equations of the corresponding backward model during runtime leading to a very fast computation speed. Since these asymptotic solutions are generally applicable to weakly absorbing media only, pre-calculated look-up tables for the reflection function of a semi-infinite cloud (and also the escape function) are used to overcome this restriction within this new retrieval. SLALOM is capable of retrieving the cloud optical thickness, the effective cloud droplet radius, the liquid and ice water paths, the particle absorption length as well as some other properties of water and ice clouds. The comparison of SLALOM with both exact radiative transfer computations and the NASA MODIS cloud property product shows a very good agreement.

  Abstract                 = {The temporal characteristics of rainfall variability in Africa are examined using departure series for 84 regions of the continent and five larger-scale zones. The forms of non- randomness which are investigated include linear trends, persistence and quasi-periodic fluctuations. No long-term trends in African rainfall are evident. In some sectors, most noteably along the Benguela coast and equatorial Africa, rainfall anomalies tend to persist over several months and interseasonal correlations are also high. Spectral analysis revealed significant quasi-periodicities clustered in four bands at 2.2-2.4, 2.6-2.8, 3.3-3.8 and 5.0-6.3 years. These are common throughout equatorial and southern Africa, but only weakly evident in northern Africa. A cross-spectral analysis with the Southern Oscillation suggests a strong influence on rainfall variability in southern Africa and parts of the equatorial region and minimal influence in northern Africa. Coherence with the Southern Oscillation is particularly strong in the QBO range of 2.2--2.4 years. In general, the co-spectra suggest an inverse relationship between the SOI and rainfall in equatorial regions (i.e., higher rainfall during low-index years) and a positive relation- ship with rainfall in most other regions where an influence can be demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is altering the availability of resources and the conditions that are crucial to plant performance. One way plants will respond to these changes is through environmentally induced shifts in phenotype (phenotypic plasticity). Understanding plastic responses is crucial for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on native species as well as crop plants. Here, we provide a toolbox with definitions of key theoretical elements and a synthesis of the current understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to climate change. By bringing ecological, evolutionary, physiological and molecular perspectives together, we hope to provide clear directives for future research and stimulate cross-disciplinary dialogue on the relevance of phenotypic plasticity under climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {This study proposes an empirical methodology for modelling and mapping the air temperature (mean maximum, mean and mean minimum) and total precipitation, all of which are monthly and annual, using geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. The method can be seen as an alternative to classical interpolation techniques when spatial information is available. The geographical area used to develop and apply this model is Catalonia (32â€ˆ000 km2, northeast Spain). We have developed a multiple regression analysis between these meteorological variables as the dependent ones, and some geographical variables (altitude (ALT), latitude (LAT), continentality (CON), solar radiation (RAD) and a cloudiness factor (CLO)) as the independent ones. Data for the dependent variables were obtained from meteorological stations, and data for the independent variables were elaborated from a 180 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Multiple regression coefficients (bn) were used to build final maps, using digital layers for each independent variable, and applying basic GIS techniques. The results are very satisfactory in the case of mean air temperature and mean minimum air temperature, with coefficients of determination (R2) between 0.79 and 0.97, depending on the month; in the case of mean maximum air temperature, R2 ranges between 0.70 and 0.89, while in the case of precipitation, it ranges between 0.60 and 0.91.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a novel system for addressing problems of local very short term (up to a time prediction horizon of 6&#xa0;h) temperature prediction based on Support Vector Regression algorithms (SVMr). Specifically, we construct \{SVMr\} banks based on the synoptic situation for each prediction period, incorporated by means of the well-known Hessâ€“Brezowsky classification (HBC). We show how this \{SVMr\} bank structure obtains very good results in a real problem of short-term temperature prediction at Barcelona-El Prat International Airport (Spain), obtaining an average \{RMSE\} of 1.34&#xa0;Â°C in 6&#xa0;hour horizon prediction. Comparison with alternative neural techniques have been carried out in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, and how the inclusion of the \{HBC\} classification is also able to improve the performance of these alternative neural algorithms in the problem. },

  Abstract                 = {Daily maximum temperature can be used a good indicator of peak energy consumption, since it can be used to predict the massive use of heating or air conditioning systems. Thus, the prediction of daily maximum temperature is an important problem with interesting applications in the energy field, since it has been proven that electricity demand depends much on weather conditions. This paper presents a novel methodology for daily maximum temperature prediction, based on a Support Vector Regression approach. The paper is focused on different measuring stations in Europe, from which different meteorological variables have been obtained, including temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and air pressure. Two more variables are also included, specifically synoptic situation of the day and monthly cycle. Using this pool of prediction variables, it is shown that the \{SVMr\} algorithm is able to give an accurate prediction of the maximum temperature 24Â h later. In the paper \{SVMr\} technique applied is fully described, including some bounds on the machine hyper-parameters in order to speed up the \{SVMr\} training process. The performance of the \{SVMr\} has been compared to that of different neural networks in the literature: a Multi-layer perceptron and an Extreme Learning Machine. },

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on satellite images can provide useful estimates of species richness and distribution patterns. However, species richness at a given site may depend not only on local habitat quality and productivity but also on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In this study we investigated whether the predictions of species richness of plant families in northern boreal landscape in Finland can be improved by incorporating greenness information from the surrounding landscape, as derived from remotely sensed data (mean, maximum, standard deviation and range values of NDVI derived from Landsat ETM), into local greenness models. Using plant species richness data of 28 plant families from 440 grid cells of 25 ha in size, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted into three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) local greenness only, (2) landscape greenness only, and (3) combined local and landscape greenness. The derived richness-greenness relationships were mainly unimodal or positively increasing but varied between different plant families, and depended also on whether greenness was measured as mean or maximum greenness. Incorporation of landscape level greenness variables improved significantly both the explanatory power and cross-validation statistics of the models including only local greenness variables. Landscape greenness information derived from remote sensing data integrated with local information has thus the potentiality to improve predictive assessments of species richness over extensive and inaccessible areas, especially in high-latitude landscapes. Overall, the significant relationship between plants and surrounding landscape quality detected here suggests that landscape factors should be considered in preserving species richness of boreal environments, as well as in conservation planning for biodiversity in other environments.

  Abstract                 = {Quercus coccifera L. is a Mediterranean sclerophyllous shrub with a high capacity to resist intense drought stress. Therefore, it could be used in the study of physiological changes suffered by plants at very low water potentials. A remote sensing sensor was used to measure continuously the physiological reflectance index (PRI; defined as the changes in reflectance at 531 nm with respect to those at 570 nm; PRI = [(R531 - R570)/(R531 + R570)] at canopy level and under field conditions in an artificial carpet of seedlings of Q. coccifera during a drought cycle. Correlations between leaf level-measured chlorophyll fluorescence parameters as well as the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle [(A + Z)/(V + A + Z)] and canopy level-measured PRI were reasonably good (R (2) = 0.57-0.63, P < 0.01), and quite interesting for water stress remote sensing purposes. The instrument's temporal resolution allowed us to follow the rapid response of PRI to changing photosynthetic active radiation, and to resolve, in response to cloud-induced changes in light intensity, a fast and a slow PRI component. We report the disappearance of the rapid one under conditions of intense drought in response to a sudden increase in light intensity. The underlying photoprotection mechanisms that Q. coccifera shows in response to intense drought stress periods seem to be related to the existence of a low intrathylakoid lumenal pH at the end of the drought cycle. Under intense drought, these mechanisms allow this species to avoid oxidative damage, which was evidenced by the maintenance of an unaltered photosynthetic pigment composition and constant photosystem II efficiency in the mornings. It is concluded that, contrary to early reports, PRI is a sensible, indirect, non-destructive water stress indicator, even in plants experiencing intense drought.},

  Abstract                 = {We compare surface climate (temperature and moisture) measured on an hourly basis at ten elevations on Kilimanjaro with equivalent observations in the free atmosphere from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, for September 2004â€“July 2008. On the lower forested slopes the mountain surface is consistently cooler and moister than the atmospheric boundary layer. In contrast, temperatures and moisture on the higher slopes above treeline (\~{}3000 m) are decoupled from the free atmosphere, showing substantial heating/cooling by day/night and import of moisture up from lower elevations during daylight hours. The mountain is universally warmer than the background atmosphere at 1500 EAT, the sparsely vegetated upper slopes acting as the focus for the most intense heating. The persistent vapour pressure excesses (N5 mb) in the forest zone move upslope during daylight and subside downslope at night. Strong seasonal contrasts are shown in the vigour of this process, the resultant mountain thermal circulation and its consequences. The synoptic forcing of this process (as represented by flow indices developed from reanalysis wind components), although evident, is relatively weak. This means that upslope flow from the forest zone is an important supplementary source of moisture for the upper slopes of the mountain and that free-air variability, although important, alone cannot account for all the variability in the summit moisture regime. Long-term ice retreat at the summit of Kilimanjaro therefore is most likely to be influenced by changes in local land-use as well as more regional free-air changes. Â©},

  Abstract                 = {Assessing how environmental changes affect the distribution and dynamics of vegetation and animal populations is becoming increasingly important for terrestrial ecologists to enable better predictions of the effects of global warming, biodiversity reduction or habitat degradation. The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context.},

  Abstract                 = {{1 The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important driver of inter-annual variations in climate and ecosystem productivity in tropical regions. Most previous studies have analysed ENSO-induced changes in climate based on a single variable, such as rainfall. Also, it is generally assumed that the ENSO impact in East Africa is geographically uniform. 2 The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the impact of ENSO on East African ecosystems, by measuring teleconnections between an ENSO index and a number of ecosystem variables in a spatially explicit way and for different time lags. We analysed the spatial patterns of teleconnections in the region by combining time series of climate variables measured for meteorological stations with time series of a vegetation index and surface temperature data measured by remote sensing. 3 Our results confirm the ENSO impact on the climatic and ecological variability in East Africa. However, the pattern of teleconnections is much more complex than generally assumed, both in terms of spatial distribution and impact on different ecosystem variables. Not all climate and land surface variables are teleconnected to ENSO in the same way, which leads to a complex impact of ENSO on the ecosystem. Moreover, the ENSO impact is highly differentiated in space, as the direction, magnitude and timing of this impact are controlled by the local climate system, the presence of large lakes, proximity to the coast and, possibly, local topography and land cover.}},

Results show that (1) uncertainties, defined as the differences between the experiments, are larger than the biases; (2) the parameters exerting the largest influence on simulated rainfall are, in order of decreasing importance, the short- wave radiation scheme, the land-surface model, the domain size, followed by convective schemes and land-use cate- gories; (3) cloud microphysics, lateral forcing reanalysis, the number of vertical levels and planetary boundary layer schemes appear to be of lesser importance at the seasonal scale.

  Abstract                 = {General scaling rules or constants for metabolic and structural plant allometry as assumed by the theory of Euclidian geometric scaling (2/3-scaling) or metabolic scaling (3/4-scaling) may meet human's innate propensity for simplicity and generality of pattern and processes in nature. However, numerous empirical works show that variability of crown structure rather than constancy is essential for a tree's success in coping with crowding. In order to link theory and empiricism, we analyzed the intra- and inter-specific scaling of crown structure for 52 tree species. The basis is data from 84 long-term plots of temperate monospecific forests under survey since 1870 and a set of 126 yield tables of angiosperm and gymnosperm forest tree species across the world. The study draws attention to (1) the intra-specific variation and correlation of the three scaling relationships: tree height versus trunk diameter, crown cross-sectional area versus trunk diameter, and tree volume versus trunk diameter, and their dependence on competition, (2) the inter-specific variation and correlation of the same scaling exponents ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) across 52 tree species, and (3) the relevance of the revealed variable scaling of crown structure for leaf organs and metabolic scaling. Our results arrive at suggesting a more extended metabolic theory of ecology which includes variability and covariation between allometric relationships as prerequisite for the individual plant's competitiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Two methods for elevation-dependent spatial interpolation of climatic data from sparse weather station networks were compared. Thirty-year monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation data from regions in western and eastern Canada were interpolated using thin-plate smoothing splines (ANUSPLIN) and a statistical method termed â€˜Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squaredâ€™ (GIDS). Data were withheld from approximately 50 stations in each region and both methods were then used to predict the monthly mean values for each climatic variable at those locations. The comparison revealed lower root mean square error (RMSE) for \{ANUSPLIN\} in 70 out of 72 months (three variables for 12 months for both regions). Higher \{RMSE\} for \{GIDS\} was caused by more frequent occurrence of extreme errors. This result had important implications for surfaces generated using the two methods. Both interpolators performed best in the eastern (Ontario/QuÃ©bec) region where topographic and climatic gradients are smoother, whereas predicting precipitation in the west (British Columbia/Alberta) was most difficult. In the latter case, \{ANUSPLIN\} clearly produced better results for most months. \{GIDS\} has certain advantages in being easy to implement and understand, hence providing a useful baseline to compare with more sophisticated methods. The significance of the errors for any method should be considered in light of the planned applications (e.g., in extensive, uniform terrain with low relief, differences may not be important). },

Using data from a long-term and comprehensive biodiversity experiment, we quantified the temporal stability of 42 variables characterizing twelve ecological functions in managed grassland plots varying in plant species richness. We demonstrate that diversity increases stability i) across trophic levels (producer, consumer), ii) at both the system (community, ecosystem) and the component levels (population, functional group, phylogenetic clade), and iii) primarily for aboveground rather than belowground processes. Temporal synchronization across studied variables was mostly unaffected with increasing species richness. This study provides the strongest empirical support so far that diversity promotes stability across different ecological functions and levels of ecosystem organization in grasslands.},

  Abstract                 = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) aim on the characterization of a species' ecological niche and project it into geographic space. The result is a map of the species' potential distribution, which is, for instance, helpful to predict the capability of alien invasive species. With regard to alien invasive species, recently several authors observed a mismatch between potential distributions of native and invasive ranges derived from SDMs and, as an explanation, ecological niche shift during biological invasion has been suggested. We studied the physiologically well known Slider turtle from North America which today is widely distributed over the globe and address the issue of ecological niche shift versus choice of ecological predictors used for model building, i.e., by deriving SDMs using multiple sets of climatic predictor.},

  Abstract                 = {Under certain conditions ships can affect the structure of shallow layer clouds. Simultaneous observations of two ship track signatures in stratus clouds from a satellite and in situ from an aircraft show that in the ship tracks the droplet sizes were reduced and total concentrations of both droplets and particles were substantially increased from those in adjacent clouds. In situ measurements of the upwelling radiance within the ship tracks was significantly enhanced at visible wavelengths, whereas radiance at 2.2 micrometers was significantly reduced. Cloud reflectivity along the tracks was enhanced at 0.63 and 3.7 micrometers. These observations support the contention that ship track signatures in clouds are produced primarily by particles emitted from ships.},

  Abstract                 = {For the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans, internal modes of variability that lead to climatic oscillations have been recognized, but in the Indian Ocean region a similar ocean-atmosphere interaction causing interannual climate variability has not yet been found. Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air-sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12\% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean--and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia--brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Instrumental observations and reconstructions of global and hemispheric temperature evolution reveal a pronounced warming during the past approximately 150 years. One expression of this warming is the observed increase in the occurrence of heatwaves. Conceptually this increase is understood as a shift of the statistical distribution towards warmer temperatures, while changes in the width of the distribution are often considered small. Here we show that this framework fails to explain the record-breaking central European summer temperatures in 2003, although it is consistent with observations from previous years. We find that an event like that of summer 2003 is statistically extremely unlikely, even when the observed warming is taken into account. We propose that a regime with an increased variability of temperatures (in addition to increases in mean temperature) may be able to account for summer 2003. To test this proposal, we simulate possible future European climate with a regional climate model in a scenario with increased atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, and find that temperature variability increases by up to 100\%, with maximum changes in central and eastern Europe.},

Our sediment record has a reliable chronology until 42 ka BP. An extrapolation of the age-depth model, as well as matching with other palaeo-records from tropical East Africa, suggest a total age of about 90 ka BP at the bottom of the record. During the last Glacial the distribution as well as the composition of the vegetation belts classified as colline savanna, submontane woodland, montane forest, ericaceous belt, and alpine vegetation changed. The early last Glacial is characterized by high amounts of Poaceae and Asteraceae pollen suggesting a climatically dry but stable phase. Based on the absence of pollen grains in samples deposited around 70 ka BP, we assume the occurrence of distinct drought periods. During the pre-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) a higher taxa diversity of the ericaceous and montane zone is recorded and suggests a spread of forest and shrub vegetation, thus indicating a more humid period. The taxa diversity increases steadily during the recorded time span. The decent of vegetation zones indicate dry and cold conditions during the LGM and seem to have been detrimental for many taxa, especially those of the forest vegetation; however, the early last Glacial seems to have been markedly drier than the LGM. The reappearance of most of the taxa (most importantly Alchemilla, Araliaceae, Dodonea, Hagenia, Ilex, Myrsine, Moraceae, Piperaceae) during the deglacial and Holocene period suggest a shift into humid conditions. An increase in ferns and the decrease in grasses during the Holocene also indicate increasing humidity. Fire played an important role in controlling the development and elevation of the ericaceous zone and the tree line. During the Holocene no increased anthropogenic impact around the Maundi crater can be observed, since neither higher fire activity nor a spread of hemerophilic plants is recorded. This pollen archive reveals shifts in the upper vegetation zones (ericaceous zone and montane forest zone) of at least 1100 m but underlines the role of Mt Kilimanjaro as a glacial refuge for montane forest species similar to that of the Eastern Arc Mountains. î€?},

The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of forest fragmentation on various aspects of the water cycle.

A total of 10 plots located on the south-western slopes of the mountain between 2100 and 2300 m.a.s.l. were monitored from May 2000 to June 2002. Annual rainfall amounts ranged from 2000 to 2600 mm with high spatial and inter-annual variability. Rainfall interception ranged from 3 to 9\% of incident rainfall in clearings, to a maximum of 32\% in forests. In general, soils under mature forest were wettest and showed only minor moisture fluctuations throughout the year. Soils of secondary forest sites were driest and soil water suction exhibited the largest fluctuations. Additionally, the finer texture of soils under mature forest compared to secondary forest sites allowed higher amounts of soil water to be stored for similar soil water suction levels. Ventilation and radiation penetration, which influence the magnitude of interception, evaporation from the forest floor and transpiration, were probably higher in fragmented secondary than in closed mature forests. In clearings, higher throughfall and presumably lower transpiration rates led to moister conditions compared to adjacent secondary forest sites. Thus, soil conditions under mature forest were most suitable for optimum water storage on Mt Kilimanjaro. The transformation of closed mature forest to a mosaic of forests in different stages of regeneration led to increased spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture.},

  Abstract                 = {Crops and livestock in most of the southeastern United States are susceptible to potential losses due to extreme cold and heat. However, given suitable warning, agricultural and horticultural producers can mitigate the damage of extreme temperature events. To provide such a warning, air temperature prediction models are needed at horizons ranging from 1 to 12&#xa0;h. The goal of this project was to explore the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the prediction of air temperature during the entire year based on near real-time data. Ward-style \{ANNs\} were developed using detailed weather data collected by the Georgia Automated Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN). The \{ANNs\} were able to provide predictions throughout the year, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of the year-round models that was less during the winter months than the \{MAE\} of the models resulting from the application of previously developed winter-specific models. The prediction \{MAE\} for a year-round evaluation set ranged from 0.516&#xa0;Â°C at the one-hour horizon to 1.873&#xa0;Â°C at the twelve-hour horizon. A detailed graphical analysis of \{MAE\} by time-of-year and time-of-day was also performed. A tendency to over-predict temperatures during summer afternoons was associated with localized cloud cover during that period. The inclusion of rainfall as input to the model was also shown to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, two simple ensemble techniques were explored and neither parallel nor series aggregation was found to reduce prediction errors. When simulated over two extreme temperature events, the models were capable of rapidly adjusting predictions on the basis of new information.

  Abstract                 = {In a balanced experiment based on 20 field plots located in a 21 km2 Scots pine forest in southeast Norway covering age classes from newly regenerated to old forest, leaf area index (LAI) was determined in field by a LAI-2000 instrument and hemispheric photography. Based on a formalized framework, i.e., the so-called Beer-Lambert law, gap fraction derived from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data was regressed against field-measured LAI. LAI was strongly (R2 = 0.87-0.93), positively, and linearly related to the log-transformed inverse of the gap fraction derived from the laser scanner data. This was as expected according to the Beer-Lambert law, as was the absence of an intercept, producing a directly proportionality of the two variables. We estimated an extinction coefficient for the first return echoes to be 0.7, fortunately fairly stable across age classes, and this is likely to be a parameter specific for the applied laser scanner system under the given flight and system settings, such as flying altitude and laser pulse repetition frequency. It was demonstrated that airborne laser was able to detect defoliation in terms of estimated changes in LAI, by three repeated laser data acquisitions over the area where severe insect attacks were going on in between the acquisitions.},

  Abstract                 = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

  Abstract                 = {Between 18,000 and 15,000 years ago, large amounts of ice and meltwater entered the North Atlantic during Heinrich Stadial 1. This caused substantial regional cooling, but major climatic impacts also occurred in the tropics. Here, we demonstrate that the height of this stadial, about 17,000 to 16,000 years ago (Heinrich Event 1), coincided with one of the most extreme and widespread megadroughts of the last 50,000 years or more in the Afro-Asian monsoon region, with potentially serious consequences for Paleolithic cultures. Late Quaternary tropical drying commonly is attributed to southward drift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, but the broad geographic range of the H1 Megadrought suggests that severe, systemic weakening of Afro-Asian rainfall systems also occurred, probably in response to sea surface cooling.},

  Abstract                 = {We summarize an advanced, thoroughly documented, and quite general purpose discrete ordinate algorithm for time-independent transfer calculations in vertically inhomogeneous, nonisothermal, plane-parallel media. Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emission at the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators-advances in both formulation and numerical solution-are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two illconditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the FORTRAN program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},

  Abstract                 = {Siting a municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plant requires a comprehensive evaluation to identify the best available location(s) that can simultaneously meet the requirements of regulations and minimise economic, environmental, health, and social costs. A spatial multi-criteria evaluation methodology is presented to assess land suitability for a plant siting and applied to Santiago Island of Cape Verde. It combines the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to estimate the selected evaluation criteria weights with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial data analysis that avoids the subjectivity of the judgements of decision makers in establishing the influences between some criteria or clusters of criteria. An innovative feature of the method lies in incorporating the environmental impact assessment of the plant operation as a criterion in the decision-making process itself rather than as an a posteriori assessment. Moreover, a two-scale approach is considered. At a global scale an initial screening identifies inter-municipal zones satisfying the decisive requirements (socio-economic, technical and environmental issues, with weights respectively, of 48\%, 41\% and 11\%). A detailed suitability ranking inside the previously identified zones is then performed at a local scale in two phases and includes environmental assessment of the plant operation. Those zones are ranked by combining the non-environmental feasibility of Phase 1 (with a weight of 75\%) with the environmental assessment of the plant operation impact of Phase 2 (with a weight of 25\%). The reliability and robustness of the presented methodology as a decision supporting tool is assessed through a sensitivity analysis. The results proved the system effectiveness in the ranking process.},

  Abstract                 = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change over the past approximately 30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37\% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18\%) than mid-range ( approximately 24\%) and maximum-change ( approximately 35\%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

  Abstract                 = {Three lines of evidence for abrupt tropical climate change, both past and present, are presented. First, annually and decadally averaged delta(18)O and net mass-balance histories for the last 400 and 2,000 yr, respectively, demonstrate that the current warming at high elevations in the mid- to low latitudes is unprecedented for at least the last 2 millennia. Second, the continuing retreat of most mid- to low-latitude glaciers, many having persisted for thousands of years, signals a recent and abrupt change in the Earth's climate system. Finally, rooted, soft-bodied wetland plants, now exposed along the margins as the Quelccaya ice cap (Peru) retreats, have been radiocarbon dated and, when coupled with other widespread proxy evidence, provide strong evidence for an abrupt mid-Holocene climate event that marked the transition from early Holocene (pre-5,000-yr-B.P.) conditions to cooler, late Holocene (post-5,000-yr-B.P.) conditions. This abrupt event, approximately 5,200 yr ago, was widespread and spatially coherent through much of the tropics and was coincident with structural changes in several civilizations. These three lines of evidence argue that the present warming and associated glacier retreat are unprecedented in some areas for at least 5,200 yr. The ongoing global-scale, rapid retreat of mountain glaciers is not only contributing to global sea-level rise but also threatening freshwater supplies in many of the world's most populous regions.},

Variable deposition of F- and Na+ during the African Humid Period suggests rapidly fluctuating lake levels between approximately 11.7 and 4 ka.

  Abstract                 = {A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7Â°C and 1.2Â°C, with biases of +0.1Â°C and âˆ’0.1Â°C, respectively. \{MAE\} for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps. },

We applied compound-specific hydrogen isotopes (dD) and the TEX86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) temperature proxy to sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika to independently reconstruct precipitation and temperature variations during the past 60,000 years. Tanganyika temperatures follow Northern Hemisphere insolation and indicate that warming in tropical southeast Africa during the last glacial termination began to increase \~{}3000 years before atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. dD data show that this region experienced abrupt changes in hydrology coeval with orbital and millennial-scale events recorded in Northern Hemisphere monsoonal climate records. This implies that precipitation in tropical southeast Africa is more strongly controlled by changes in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the winter Indian monsoon than by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone},

  Abstract                 = {The shrinking glacier atop Kilimanjaro has received much attention as it is one of the few remaining tropical glaciers in the world. Physical drivers ranging from changes in temperature and humidity to shifts in cloud coverage and radiation have been attributed to reducing the ice mass. Studies have utilized varying methods and often use point data sources that tend to be spatially and temporally poor in the region. The objective of this study was to use complementing remote sensing data sets with systematic measurements to delineate ice cap fluctuations and land surface phenology on Kilimanjaro over the past two decades. Multitemporal, fine-scale Landsat imagery (30 m) showed approximately a 70\% reduction in ice coverage since 1976. High-frequency (bimonthly) image analysis conducted along a human activityâ€“elevation ecocline showed that the entire mountain, including the subalpine and alpine regions, has undergone an increase in vegetative signal indicating a â€˜â€˜greening upâ€™â€™ of Kilimanjaro over the past two decades. In addition, upper elevations of Kilimanjaro have undergone a temporal shift, or lengthening, in dry season phenology on the order of one month over the past two decades. The shift in dry season timing is concordant with maximum ablation periods. Overall, this study provides insight into land surface trends at resolutions that are currently lacking in Kilimanjaro climate change analyses.},

Here we contend that the combined effects of this biotic and abiotic diversity promote exceptional biogeochemical heterogeneity at multiple scales. At local levels, high plant diversity creates variation in chemical and structural traits that affect plant production, decomposition and nutrient cycling. At regional levels, myriad combinations of soil age, soil chemistry and landscape dynamics create variation and uncertainty in limiting nutrients that do not exist at higher latitudes. The effects of such heterogeneity are not well captured in large-scale estimates of tropical ecosystem function, but we suggest new developments in remote sensing can help bridge the gap.},

  Abstract                 = {{An approximate formulation of how much moisture that precipitates out comes from local evaporation versus horizontal transport, referred to as ``recycling,{''} has allowed new estimates of recycling, to be mapped globally as a function of length scale. The recycling is formulated in terms of the ``intensity of the hydrological cycle{''} I, which is alternatively referred to as a ``precipitation efficiency{''} as it denotes the fraction of moisture flowing through a region that is precipitated out, and a ``moistening efficiency,{''} M, which is defined as the fraction of moisture evaporated from a region to that flowing through. While datasets of the pertinent quantities have improved, they still contain uncertainties. Results show that often the intensity is not greatest at times of greatest precipitation because moisture transport into the region is also a maximum, especially in the monsoonal regions. The annual cycle variations of I are fairly small over North America and Europe while large seasonal variations in M occur in most places. Seasonal mean maps of precipitation, evaporation (E), and atmospheric moisture transport are presented and discussed along with the seasonal and annual means of derived precipitation and moisture efficiencies and the recycling Fraction. The recycling results depend greatly on the scale of the domain under consideration and global maps of the recycling for seasonal and annual means are produced for 500- and 1000-km scales that therefore allow the heterogeneity of the fields across river basins to be captured. Global annual mean recycling for 500-km scales is 9.6\%, consisting of 8.9\% over land and 9.9\% over the oceans. Even for 1000-km scales, less than 20\% of the annual precipitation typically comes from evaporation within that domain. Over the Amazon, strong advection of moisture dominates the supply of atmospheric moisture over much of the river basin but local evaporation is much more prominent over the southern parts, and, for the annual cycle as a whole, about 34\% of the moisture is recycled. Over the Mississippi Basin, the recycling is about 21\%. The smaller number mostly reflects the smaller domain size. Relatively high annual values of recycling (>20\%) occur in the subtropical highs. where E is high and the advective moisture flux is small, and in convergence zones where, again, the advective moisture flux is small. Low annual values occur over the southern oceans, the North Pacific, and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where the moisture flux is at a maximum.}},

  Abstract                 = {In situ collected spectrometer data were used to evaluate and quantify the relationships between various linear combinations of red and photographic infrared radiances and experimental plot biomass, leaf water content, and chlorophyll content. The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the \{IR\} and red linear combinations vis-Ã -vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and \{IR\} linear combinations had 7% and 14% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four \{ER\} and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic \{IR\} radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies. },

Ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model are used to understand the relative effect of local and large-scale Indian Ocean SST anomalies on above-average East African precipitation. The importance of the various tropical and subtropical IOD SST poles, both indi- vidually and in combination, is quantified. In the simulations, enhanced East African â€˜â€˜short rainsâ€™â€™ are predominantly driven by the local warm SST anomalies in the western equatorial Indian Ocean, while the eastern cold pole of the tropical IOD is of lesser importance. The changed East African rainfall distribution can be explained by a reorganization of the atmospheric circulation induced by the SST anomalies. A reduction in sea level pressure over the western half of the Indian Ocean and converging wind anomalies over East Africa lead to moisture convergence and increased convective activity over the region. The pattern of large-scale circulation changes over the tropical Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses is consistent with an anomalous strengthening of the Walker cell. The seasonal cycle of various indices related to the SST and the atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Indian Ocean are examined to assess their potential usefulness for seasonal forecasting.},

  Abstract                 = {Temperature forecasting has been one of the most important factors considered in climate impact studies on sectors of agriculture, vegetation, water resources and tourism. The main purpose of this study is to forecast daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature time series employing three different artificial neural network (ANN) methods and provide the best-fit prediction with the observed actual data using ANN algorithms.The geographical location considered is one of Turkey's most important areas of agricultural production, the Geyve and Sakarya basin, located in the south-east of the Marmara region (40Â°N and 30Â°E). The methods chosen in this study are: (1) feed-forward back propagation (FFBP), (2) radial basis function (RBF) and, (3) generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Additionally, predictions with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model were compared to those of the ANN methods. All three different ANN methods provide satisfactory predictions in terms of the selected performance criteria; correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA) and the results compared well with the conventional MLR method.

  Abstract                 = {Conceptually, plant functional types represent a classification scheme between species and broad vegetation types. Historically, these were based on physiological, structural and/or phenological properties, whereas recently, they have reflected plant responses to resources or environmental conditions. Often, an underlying assumption, based on an economic analogy, is that the functional role of vegetation can be identified by linked sets of morphological and physiological traits constrained by resources, based on the hypothesis of functional convergence. Using these concepts, ecologists have defined a variety of functional traits that are often context dependent, and the diversity of proposed traits demonstrates the lack of agreement on universal categories. Historically, remotely sensed data have been interpreted in ways that parallel these observations, often focused on the categorization of vegetation into discrete types, often dependent on the sampling scale. At the same time, current thinking in both ecology and remote sensing has moved towards viewing vegetation as a continuum rather than as discrete classes. The capabilities of new remote sensing instruments have led us to propose a new concept of optically distinguishable functional types ('optical types') as a unique way to address the scale dependence of this problem. This would ensure more direct relationships between ecological information and remote sensing observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait-mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the mid-nineteenth century the Earth's surface has warmed, and models indicate that human activities have caused part of the warming by altering the radiative balance of the atmosphere. Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation. An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean--driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east--known as the Walker circulation. Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century.},

  Abstract                 = {The interannual variability of the Indian Ocean SST is investigated by analyzing data from observations and an integration of a global coupled GCM (CGCM) ECHO-2. First, it is demonstrated that the CGCM is capable of producing realistic tropical climate variability. Second, it is shown that a considerable part of the interannual variability in Indian Ocean SST can be described as the response to interannual fluctuations over the Pacific related to ENSO. Although the Indian Ocean region also exhibits ENSO-independent interannual variability, this paper focuses on the ENSO-induced component only. Large-scale SST anomalies of the same sign as those observed in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during ENSO extremes develop in the entire tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean with a time lag of about 4 months. This leadâ€“lag relationship is found in both the observations and the CGCM. Using the CGCM output, it is shown that the ENSO signal is carried into the Indian Ocean mainly through anomalous surface heat fluxes},

  Abstract                 = {A method has been developed for retrieving the scattering and microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosol from measurements of solar transmission, aureole, and angular distribution of the scattered and polarized sky light in the solar principal plane. Numerical simulations of measurements have been used to investigate the feasibility of the method and to test the algorithm's performance. It is shown that the absorption and scattering properties of an aerosol, i.e., the single-scattering albedo, the phase function, and the polarization for single scattering of incident unpolarized light, can be obtained by use of radiative transfer calculations to correct the values of scattered radiance and polarized radiance for multiple scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and the influence of ground. The method requires only measurement of the aerosol's optical thickness and an estimate of the ground's reflectance and does not need any specific assumption about properties of the aerosol. The accuracy of the retrieved phase function and polarization of the aerosols is examined at near-infrared wavelengths (e.g., 0.870 mum). The aerosol's microphysical properties (size distribution and complex refractive index) are derived in a second step. The real part of the refractive index is a strong function of the polarization, whereas the imaginary part is strongly dependent on the sky's radiance and the retrieved single-scattering albedo. It is demonstrated that inclusion of polarization data yields the real part of the refractive index.},

Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability.

Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional ( approximately 11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper analyzes the validity of various precipitation and temperature maps obtained by means of diverse interpolation methods. The study was carried out in an area where geographic differences and spatial climatic diversity are significant (the middle Ebro Valley in the northeast Of Spain). Two variables, annual precipitation and temperature, and several interpolation methods were used in the climate mapping: global interpolators (trend surfaces and regression models), local interpolators (Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighting, splines), geostatistical methods (simple kriging, ordinary kriging, block kriging, directional kriging, universal kriging and co-kriging) and mixed methods (combined global, local and geostatistical methods). The validity of the maps was checked through independent test weather stations (30\% of the original stations). Different statistical accuracy measurements determined the quality of the models. The results show that some interpolation methods are very similar. Nevertheless, in the case of precipitation maps, we obtained the best results using geostatistical methods and a regression model formed by 4 geographic and topographic variables. The best results for temperature mapping were obtained using the regression-based method. The accuracy measurements obtained by the different interpolation methods change significantly depending on the climatic variable mapped. The validity of interpolation methods in the creation of climatic maps, useful for agricultural and hydrologic management, is discussed.}},

  Abstract                 = {LiDAR remote sensing has been used to examine relationships between vertebrate diversity and environmental characteristics, but its application to invertebrates has been limited. Our objectives were to determine whether LiDAR-derived variables could be used to accurately describe single-species distributions and community characteristics of spiders in remote forested and mountainous terrain. We collected over 5300 spiders across multiple transects in the Bavarian National Park (Germany) using pitfall traps. We examined spider community characteristics (species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, community composition, mean body size, and abundance) and single-species distribution and abundance with LiDAR variables and ground-based measurements. We used the R2 and partial R2 provided by variance partitioning to evaluate the predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables compared to ground measurements for each of the community characteristics. The total adjusted R2 for species richness, the Shannon index, community species composition, and body size had a range of 25-57\%. LiDAR variables and ground measurements both contributed >80\% to the total predictive power. For species composition, the explained variance was approximately 32\%, which was significantly greater than expected by chance. The predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables was comparable or superior to that of the ground-based variables for examinations of single-species distributions, and it explained up to 55\% of the variance. The predictability of species distributions was higher for species that had strong associations with shade in open-forest habitats, and this niche position has been well documented across the European continent for spider species. The similar statistical performance between LiDAR and ground-based measures at our field sites indicated that deriving spider community and species distribution information using LiDAR data can provide not only high predictive power at relatively low cost, but may also allow unprecedented mapping of community- and species-level spider information at scales ranging from stands to landscapes. Therefore, LiDAR is a viable tool to assist species-specific conservation as well as broader biodiversity planning efforts not only for a growing list of vertebrates, but for invertebrates as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Missouri ranks second in cow-calf numbers in the United States and its pastureland has experienced invasion of various plant species. As one of the invasive weeds, sericea lespedeza is becoming a serious threat to pasturelands in this state. The in-situ field survey in these vast pastures is time consuming and often impossible because of accessibility. Typical aerial survey is also difficult to detect sericea because the plant is of similar size and color as natural grass and, thus, cannot be effectively discriminated in broadband aerial color photos. This study used an airborne hyperspectral image to map sericea and its invasiveness in a public grass field in Mid-Missouri. The maximal 1st-order derivative in red-near infrared region (650-800nm) was derived to separate sericea from fescue, the dominant grass in pastures in Missouri. With a simple threshold approach, sericea of various sizes were identified in the study area. It was also found that the maximal 1st-order derivatives of sericea patches were log-linearly related to sericea "volume," a quasi 3-dimensional biophysical variable as an approximate measure of sericea invasiveness. The squared correlation coefficient (r2) of the regression was 0.65 and the estimation error of sericea "volume" estimation was 11\% based on ground measurements at 27 sample sites. With this empirical regression model, the quantitative distribution of sericea volume was mapped, which could serve as a first step in alerting landowners and the general public about the seriousness of sericea invasion in Missouri pasturelands.},

  Abstract                 = {Australia typically experiences drought during El Ni\~{n}o, especially across the eastern two-thirds of the continent during austral spring (Septemberâ€“November). There have, however, been some interesting de- partures from this paradigm. For instance, the near-record-strength El Ni\~{n}o of 1997 was associated with near-normal rainfall. In contrast, eastern Australia experienced near-record drought during the modest El Ni\~{n}o of 2002. This stark contrast raises the issue of how the magnitude of the drought is related to the character and magnitude of El Ni\~{n}o, for instance as measured by the broadscale sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the equatorial eastern Pacific. Internal (unpredictable) atmospheric noise is one plausible explanation for this contrasting behavior during these El Ni\~{n}o events. Here, the authors suggest that Australian rainfall is sensitive to the zonal distribution of SST anomalies during El Ni\~{n}o and, in particular, the greatest sensitivity is to the SST variations on the eastern edge of the Pacific warm pool rather than in the eastern Pacific where El Ni\~{n}o variations are typically largest. Positive SST anomalies maximized near the date line in 2002, but in 1997 maximum anomalies were shifted well into the eastern Pacific, where their influence on Australian rainfall appears to be less. These findings provide a plausible physical basis for the view that forecasting the strength of El Ni\~{n}o is not sufficient to accurately predict rainfall variations across Australia during El Ni\~{n}o.},

  Abstract                 = {Two methods, eddy covariance and chamber-based measurements, were employed to measure the net ecosystem CO(2) exchange in a mature temperate mixed forest in 2003. The eddy covariance system was used as a reference, which was compared with the chamber-based method. Based on chamber fluxes, the ecosystem had a gross primary production of 1490 g C m(-2) year(-1), 90\% of which was released as efflux back into the air via respiration of the entire ecosystem. This was comprised of about 48\% from soil surface CO(2) efflux, 31\% from leaf respiration and 21\% from stem and branch respiration. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE), estimated from the sum of daily component fluxes, was 146 g C m(-2) year(-1). Ecosystem respiration (ER), estimated from the sum of daily ecosystem respiration, was 1240 g C m(-2) year(-1). NEE was 9.8\% of actual gross primary production (GPP). The eddy covariance estimates of NEE, ER and GPP were 188, 1030 and 1220 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The eddy covariance estimation of NEE was higher than that of the chamber-based estimation by 22.5\%. On a daily basis, NEE of the scaled chamber measurements was in acceptable agreement with eddy covariance measurement data with R(2) values of 0.71. The discrepancy between the measurement of the two methods was greater in the non-growing season primarily due to the lack of spatial variability in the scaled chamber estimates and weak atmosphere turbulence by eddy covariance measurements. There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of ecosystem component flux. More detailed experiments and related theoretical studies are needed in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {A procedure for both vertical canopy structure analysis and 3D single tree modelling based on Lidar point cloud is presented in this paper. The whole area of research is segmented into small study cells by a raster net. For each cell, a normalized point cloud whose point heights represent the absolute heights of the ground objects is generated from the original Lidar raw point cloud. The main tree canopy layers and the height ranges of the layers are detected according to a statistical analysis of the height distribution probability of the normalized raw points. For the 3D modelling of individual trees, individual trees are detected and delineated not only from the top canopy layer but also from the sub canopy layer. The normalized points are resampled into a local voxel space. A series of horizontal 2D projection images at the different height levels are then generated respect to the voxel space. Tree crown regions are detected from the projection images. Individual trees are then extracted by means of a pre-order forest traversal process through all the tree crown regions at the different height levels. Finally, 3D tree crown models of the extracted individual trees are reconstructed. With further analyses on the 3D models of individual tree crowns, important parameters such as crown height range, crown volume and crown contours at the different height levels can be derived.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate variability in the Indian Ocean region seems to be, in some aspects, independent of forcing by external phenomena such as the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation. But the extent to which, and how, internal coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics determine the state of the Indian Ocean system have not been resolved. Here we present a detailed analysis of the strong seasonal anomalies in sea surface temperatures, sea surface heights, precipitation and winds that occurred in the Indian Ocean region in 1997-98, and compare the results with the record of Indian Ocean climate variability over the past 40 years. We conclude that the 1997-98 anomalies--in spite of the coincidence with the strong El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation event--may primarily be an expression of internal dynamics, rather than a direct response to external influences. We propose a mechanism of ocean-atmosphere interaction governing the 1997-98 event that may represent a characteristic internal mode of the Indian Ocean climate system. In the Pacific Ocean, the identification of such a mode has led to successful predictions of El Ni\~{n}o; if the proposed Indian Ocean internal mode proves to be robust, there may be a similar potential for predictability of climate in the Indian Ocean region.},

The El Nin Ëœo Modoki phenomenon is characterized by the anomalously warm central equatorial Pacific flanked by anomalously cool regions in both west and east. Such zonal SST gradients result in anomalous two-cell Walker Cir- culation over the tropical Pacific, with a wet region in the central Pacific. There are two mid-tropospheric wave trains passing over the extratropical and subtropical North Pa- cific. They contain a positive phase of a Pacific-Japan pattern in the northwestern Pacific, and a positive phase of a summertime Pacific-North American pattern in the northeastern Pacific/North America region. The western North Pacific summer monsoon is enhanced, while the East Asian summer monsoon is weakened. In the South Pacific, there is a basin-wide low in the mid-latitude with enhanced Australian high and the eastern South Pacific subtropical high. Such an atmospheric circulation pattern favors a dry rim surrounding the wet central tropical Pacific. The El Nin Ëœo Modoki and its climate impacts are very different H. Weng î€? K. Ashok î€? S. K.

  Abstract                 = {Present work compares impacts of El Ni\~{n}o Modoki and El Ni\~{n}o on anomalous climate in the Pacific rim during boreal winters of 1979-2005. El Ni\~{n}o Modoki (El Ni\~{n}o) is associated with tripole (dipole) patterns in anomalies of sea-surface temperature, precipitation, and upper-level divergent wind in the tropical Pacific, which are related to multiple â€œboomerangsâ€? of ocean-atmosphere conditions in the Pacific. Zonal and meridional extents of those â€œboomerangsâ€? reflect their independent influences, which are seen from lower latitudes in the west to higher latitudes in the east. In the central Pacific, more moisture is transported from the tropics to higher latitudes during El Ni\~{n}o Modoki owing to displacement of the wet â€œboomerangâ€? arms more poleward toward east. Discontinuities at outer â€œboomerangâ€? arms manifest intense interactions between tropical and subtropical/extratropical systems. The Pacific/North American pattern and related climate anomalies in North America found in earlier studies are modified in very different ways by the two phenomena. The seesaw with the dry north and the wet south in the western USA is more likely to occur during El Ni\~{n}o Modoki, while much of the western USA is wet during El Ni\~{n}o. The moisture to the southwestern USA is transported from the northward shifted ITCZ during El Ni\~{n}o Modoki, while it is carried by the storms traveling along the southerly shifted polar front jet during El Ni\~{n}o. The East Asian winter monsoon related anticyclone is over the South China Sea during El Ni\~{n}o Modoki as compared to its position over the Philippine Sea during El Ni\~{n}o, causing opposite precipitation anomalies in the southern East Asia between the two phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of robust object-based classification methods suitable for medium to high resolution satellite imagery provides a valid alternative to `traditional' pixel-based methods. This paper compares the results of an object-based classification to a supervised per-pixel classification for mapping land cover in the tropical north of the Northern Territory of Australia. The object-based approach involved segmentation of image data into objects at multiple scale levels. Objects were assigned classes using training objects and the Nearest Neighbour supervised and fuzzy classification algorithm. The supervised pixel-based classification involved the selection of training areas and a classification using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm. Site-specific accuracy assessment using confusion matrices of both classifications were undertaken based on 256 reference sites. A comparison of the results shows a statistically significant higher overall accuracy of the object-based classification over the pixel-based classification. The incorporation of a digital elevation model (DEM) layer and associated class rules into the object-based classification produced slightly higher accuracies overall and for certain classes; however this was not statistically significant over the object-based using spectral information solely. The results indicate object-based analysis has good potential for extracting land cover information from satellite imagery captured over spatially heterogeneous land covers of tropical Australia.},

This framework could allow us to understand, for the first time, the genetic basis of ecosystem processes, and the effect of such phenomena as climate change and introduced transgenic organisms on entire communities.},

Wind, temperature, and humidity cannot be measured continuously in space. In this paper we present simple methods to determine values of those variables for non-ideal positions from measurements at a single ideal point and test these spatial functions by measurements at three non-ideal points in a catchment. For wind, we were able to obtain a relatively good fit by taking the sheltering effects of the catchment rims into account. Temperature was not regionalizable with simple approaches, but needs to be regionalized with spatially and temporally differentiated models. Specific humidity can be assumed to be homogeneously distributed even though there were sinks and sources for water vapor in the study area. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This study investigates the impacts of the Indian Ocean on the relationship between the Indian summer monsoon and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through numerical simulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model and atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments with specified sea surface temperature (SST) and surface heat flux (SHF) forcing. Previous studies have shown that this particular coupled model captures many aspects of the observed Indian summer monsoon-ENSO relationship. However, it is found that, when the Indian Ocean is decoupled from the atmosphere, the Indian monsoon-ENSO relationship reverses. This change is linked to the relationships between surface evaporation, surface wind, and SST in the north Indian Ocean. In the coupled case, surface evaporation anomalies are positively correlated with surface wind anomalies during April-June and are of the same sign as SST anomalies during July-September. In the decoupled Indian Ocean case, surface evaporation anomalies are of the same sign as surface wind anomalies during the entire April-September period. Numerical experiments with an AGCM were performed with SST or SHF anomalies specified in the tropical Indian-Pacific Ocean, tropical Pacific Ocean only, and tropical Indian Ocean only. These experiments confirm the importance of local coupled air-sea feedback in the Indian Ocean for a proper simulation of the Indian monsoon-ENSO relationship.}},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term daily climatological data are important to study forest damage and simulate tree growth, but they are scarce in forested areas because observational records are often scarce. At the eight Bavarian forest sites, we examined six interpolation methods and established empirical transfer functions relating observed forest climate data to the climate data of German weather stations. Based on our comparisons, a technique is developed and used to reconstruct 31-year daily forest climatological data at six forest sites. The reconstructed climate data were then used to calculate four meteorological stress factors which are of importance to forest studies. Finally, the uncertainties, temporal and spatial variation of these stress factors were discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {{Six methods were used to interpolate the monthly mean climatological data from German climate stations to three Bavarian forest climate stations. The observed forest climatological data at the Bavarian forest climate stations were used as the reference data to which the interpolated data were compared. The results show that, for monthly mean daily maximum temperature at valley and plain forest climate stations, each of the six interpolation methods can give accurate estimates. For monthly mean daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, air temperature and water vapor pressure at mountain forest climate stations, topographically aided interpolation can give the most accurate estimates. Barnes interpolation combined with empirical transfer functions can give accurate estimates for all climate variables at the plain and valley forest climate stations, and it can also give accurate estimates for monthly mean wind speed and monthly precipitation at the mountain forest climate station. The empirical transfer functions are very important for estimating the forest climatological data. These transfer functions will be used for reconstruction of long-term forest climatological data in Bavaria.}},

  Abstract                 = {El Ni\~{n}o events, characterized by anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, have global climatic teleconnections and are the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales. Understanding changes in the frequency or characteristics of El Ni\~{n}o events in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Recent studies show that the canonical El Ni\~{n}o has become less frequent and that a different kind of El Ni\~{n}o has become more common during the late twentieth century, in which warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific are flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs. This type of El Ni\~{n}o, termed the central Pacific El Ni\~{n}o (CP-El Ni\~{n}o; also termed the dateline El Ni\~{n}o, El Ni\~{n}o Modoki or warm pool El Ni\~{n}o), differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Ni\~{n}o (EP-El Ni\~{n}o) in both the location of maximum SST anomalies and tropical-midlatitude teleconnections. Here we show changes in the ratio of CP-El Ni\~{n}o to EP-El Ni\~{n}o under projected global warming scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set. Using calculations based on historical El Ni\~{n}o indices, we find that projections of anthropogenic climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Ni\~{n}o compared to the EP-El Ni\~{n}o. When restricted to the six climate models with the best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Ni\~{n}o to EP-El Ni\~{n}o, the occurrence ratio of CP-El Ni\~{n}o/EP-El Ni\~{n}o is projected to increase as much as five times under global warming. The change is related to a flattening of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical principles applied to remote sensing data are key to successfully quantifying vegetation physiological condition from the study of the light interaction with the canopy under observation. We used the fluorescence-reflectance-transmittance (FRT) and PROSPECT leaf models to simulate reflectance as a function of leaf biochemical and fluorescence variables. A series of laboratory measurements of spectral reflectance at leaf and canopy levels and a modeling study were conducted, demonstrating that effects of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) can be detected by remote sensing. The coupled FRT and PROSPECT model enabled CF and chlorophyll a + b (Ca + b) content to be estimated by inversion. Laboratory measurements of leaf reflectance (r) and transmittance (t) from leaves with constant Ca + b allowed the study of CF effects on specific fluorescence-sensitive indices calculated in the Photosystem I (PS-I) and Photosystem II (PS-II) optical region, such as the curvature index [CUR; (R675.R690)/R2(683)]. Dark-adapted and steady-state fluorescence measurements, such as the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fm), steady state maximal fluorescence (F'm), steady state fluorescence (Ft), and the effective quantum yield (delta F/F'm) are accurately estimated by inverting the FRT-PROSPECT model. A double peak in the derivative reflectance (DR) was related to increased CF and Ca + b concentration. These results were consistent with imagery collected with a compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) sensor from sites of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) of high and low stress conditions, showing a double peak on canopy derivative reflectance in the red-edge spectral region. We developed a derivative chlorophyll index (DCI; calculated as D705/D722), a function of the combined effects of CF and Ca + b content, and used it to detect vegetation stress.},

  Abstract                 = {During the last decade compound-specific D/H analysis of plant leafwax-derived n-alkanes has become a promising and popular tool in paleoclimate research. This is based amongst other factors mainly on the finding that sedimentary n-alkanes primarily reflect the D/H isotopic composition of precipitation or lake water. Recently, several authors also suggested that D/H of n-alkanes can be used as proxy in paleoaltimetry studies, because they found soil n-alkanes reflecting the â€˜altitude effectâ€™ of D/H in precipitation. Here we present results from a D/H transect study (1700 to 4000 m a.s.l.) carried out on the humid south-western slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. While D/H of precipitation shows the expected altitude effect, i.e. more negative deltaD values with increasing altitude, deltaD of nC29 and nC31 do not confirm this trend or even become more positive both in the O-layers (organic layers) and the Ah-horizons (mineral topsoils). Furthermore, deltaD of nC29 and nC31 are similar, but not identical (R2 = 0.22 and 0.34 for the O-layers and the Ah-horizons, respectively). Although overall our D/H n-alkane results are in agreement with the results of Peterse et al., (2009, Biogeo- sciences) reported for the south-eastern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, we suggest a re-interpretation.We explain the lacking correlation of D/H(alkanes) with D/H(precipitation) with other factors influencing D/H(alkanes) of plants and soils. First, large interspecies offsets in net fractionation are reported. Indeed, plant communities along the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro as well as along most altitude transects change dramatically. Second, D-enrichment by evapotranspiration (soil water and plant leaf-water), depending mainly on relative air humidity (RH) is neither constant along altitude transects nor over time. And third, soil n-alkanes do not only derive from plant litter but also from soil microorganisms (Zech et al., 2011, GCA), potentially adulterating the original plant D/H signal. Given that our results highlight that n-alkanes in soils do not necessarily reflect the D/H isotopic composition of precipitation, we conclude that care has to be taken not to over-interpret D/H records from soils and sediments when reconstruction D/H of paleoprecipitation. Concerning paleoaltimetry studies, they additionally would require that D/H of paleoprecipitation did not change significantly. Recalling the temperature-, the amount- and the source-effect, we doubt this is case.},

Although a wide range of geochemical analyses has been performed (elemental composition, bulk isotope measurements, mineralogy, grain size), the most interesting results come from hydrogen isotopic measurements of long-chain fatty acids and alkanes, which provide qualitative estimates of past changes in precipitation.

Instead, theYounger Dryas and the Last Glacial Maximum are characterized by $\delta$Denrichment (=aridity) of âˆ¼15î?¨ and âˆ¼20î?¨ compared to the Early/Middle Holocene, suggesting that northern hemispheric boundary conditions and the resultant southward migration of the ITCZ influenced moisture advection. Much more arid conditions (âˆ¼30î?¨enrichment) must be inferred for the paleosols older than âˆ¼60 ka.
